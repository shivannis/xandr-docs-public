# Segment usage by buyers

The way a given client utilizes shared segments, contextual, behavioral or otherwise, is highly dependent upon they way the client is integrated with Xandr. Clients who have implemented their own bidder will see the full details for every impression. For more details, see [Xandr's Bidders](#xandrs-bidders). Clients using traffic campaigns will see the segments available for targeting but do not have visibility into the details for each auction. For more details, see [Xandr's UI clients](#xandrs-ui-clients).

## Xandr's Bidders

Bidders receive full details of every auction on the bid request. These details include:

- Auction ID
- Xandr User ID
- Referrer URL
- IP Address
- Segment information for all owned segments
- Segment information for segments which have been shared by a data provider

Use of this information is entirely reliant upon targeting logic built into the bidder's architecture.

Below is a sample bid request containing the information mentioned above. Note the fields "auction_id_64", "user_id_64", "segments", "url" and "ip_address":
