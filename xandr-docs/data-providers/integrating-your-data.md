# Integrating your data

There are several steps to integrating your data. The typical data provider integration involves the following process:

1. The data provider and Xandr enter into an agreement consisting of a mutual non-disclosure agreement and a data licensing agreement.
1. Xandr and the data provider meet to discuss and determine the details of the integration between the two systems.
1. The data provider gives Xandr a business development contact. This information is provided to Xandr UI clients in the Help Center within Xandr.
1. Your data is then integrated. This process is determined largely by the type of data being integrated. See the following pages for details:
