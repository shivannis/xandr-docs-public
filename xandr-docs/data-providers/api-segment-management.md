# API segment management

## API segment management

Data providers will need to use Xandr's
impression bus API (api.adnxs.com) to create,
modify and delete segments. For any API interaction, you will need the
following:

1. Authorization: see [Authentication Service](../digital-platform-api/authentication-service.md)
1. Segment creation or modification: see [Segment Service](../digital-platform-api/segment-service.md)

## Best practices

When managing the data provider segments, the following best practices
should be adhered to:

- **Use codes**: Integration codes (the "code" field on the segment
  service) allows a data provider to inject their own identifiers into
  the Xandr backend. This allows users to be
  added to segments using an alternative syntax, specifying the
  integration code rather than the Xandr ID. The
  primary benefit to using codes is that the API enforces unique code
  values within a single member. If integration codes are utilized for
  all data provider segments in a given
  Xandr member's account, the uniqueness check
  will ensure that duplicate segments are not created.
- **Keep segment names consistent**: In general, data provider segments
  use a consistent naming convention. This makes data provider segments
  easier to find by allowing the user to search in
   by data provider name or hierarchy structure.
  The details of the naming convention are below:
  - The name of the data provider is appended in parentheses, e.g.,
    "Segment 1 (Data Provider Name)"
  - Hierarchies are denoted using the greater than symbol ("\>"), e.g.,
    "Parent Group \> Child Group (Data Provider Name)"
  - The segment name must not be longer 255 characters, including the
    data provider name. If a segment name with the data provider name
    appended is longer than 255 characters, the segment name should be
    truncated to fit the data provider name.

  > [!TIP]
  > The "segment name" here corresponds to the value of the `short_name` field in the JSON used to create the segment (see [Segment Service](../digital-platform-api/segment-service.md) for more information).

- **Specify an expiry time**: Many integrations will only consist of
  adding users to segments and not removing users from segments. For
  this reason, it is necessary to specify a period of time after which a
  user will drop out of a segment if they are not added to that segment
  prior to the expiration. If no expiration time is specified, a user
  remains in the segment until they are explicitly removed or they purge
  their cookies.
- **Set max usersync pixels to 0**: (This is only relevant for audience
  segments that are being placed on a page.) By default, all client-side
  segment pixel calls will result in redirecting the user to a usersync
  pixel for at least one of Xandr's supply,
  demand or data partners depending on the pixel rotation and the number
  of times the user has already been synced in recent history. In order
  to avoid this usersyncing process, set the "max_usersync_pixels"
  parameter on the segment service to 0. This prevents the user from
  being redirected from the segment pixel to the usersync pixel. Please
  note that by setting this parameter to 0, it may limit the overlap
  between available inventory and users in the data provider segments.
  The usersync process enables communication about each user across
  multiple platforms outside of Xandr, giving a
  unified view of the user across a larger portion of internet traffic.
  For more information, see "User ID Syncing" in
   documentation (client login required).
- **Make sure clients are targeting just your segments on a single
  campaign**: Campaigns that are actively targeting segments belonging
  to multiple data providers may have data billing issues down the line
  because currently buyers only have visibility into campaign level
  spend and impressions rather than segment level visibility into spend
  and impressions within a campaign.
