# Microsoft Invest - Advertiser Analytics report

The Advertiser Analytics report lets you view buy-side data for a specific advertiser. The data available via this report is even more
granular than what you can get from the [Member Analytics Report](network-analytics-report.md).

## Time frame

All dates and times are given in UTC.

### Time ranges

Time ranges define the time period of the data extracted for the report. The following is a complete list of time ranges available for reports.

However, all time ranges are not available for every report.

- Custom
- Current Hour
- Last Available Day
- Last Hour
- Today
- Last 24 Hours
- Last 48 Hours
- Yesterday
- Last 2 Days
- Last 7 Days
- Last 7 Available Days
- Last 14 Days

- Last 30 Days
- Last 30 Available Days
- Last Month
- Last 100 Days
- Last 365 Days
- Quarter to Date
- Month to Date
- Month to Yesterday
- Lifetime

### Intervals

Intervals determine how your data is grouped together into rows in the report response. The following is a complete list of intervals available for reports. However, all intervals are not available for every report.

- Hourly: Data is grouped into rows by the hour.
- Daily: Data is grouped into rows by the day.
- Monthly: Data is grouped into rows by the month.
- Cumulative: Data is grouped together in one figure, covering the entire selected time range.

> [!NOTE]
> For impressions older than 100 days, the day will be returned rather than the hour.

For more information about how quickly report data is processed, see [Availability of Reporting Data](availability-of-reporting-data.md).

## Data retention period

Most data in this report is maintained permanently (exceptions noted
below). After:

- 100 days, you are no longer able to report on hourly data (however, daily, monthly and cumulative intervals are still available)
- 14 months, you are no longer able to report on individual:
  - Creatives
  - Placements
  - Brands

In some cases Analytics reports can show delivery that does not match statistics shown elsewhere in Microsoft Invest for a
given advertiser or publisher. This is due to the way that Analytics reporting data older than 100 days and 14 months is aggregated. The data from Billing reports are kept in non-aggregated form indefinitely.

## Real time data

Real Time Data is offered within this report (not all users have access). Traditionally, reports have had a 2 hour built-in delay to
allow for a fuller reconciliation with conversions, impressions and other metrics associated with transactions. However, in some cases, it is important to have up-to-the-minute information even if it has not been fully reconciled yet. Dimensions which support the real-time option are marked with the clock icon.

:::image type="content" source="./media/real-time-data-reporting.png" alt-text="Diagram of a real time data.":::

- To use this new feature, set the **Real Time Data** field to **Included**. This will cause the data in your report to contain both real-time and the more fully reconciled batch file data. If you want the report to break out the real-time data from batch file data, select the **Real-Time status** checkbox.
- Do not use information in the real-time data portion of your report to bill your clients as that data may change slightly once fully
  reconciled within 2 to 4 hours. For more information about how quickly reporting data is processed, see [Availability of Reporting Data](availability-of-reporting-data.md).

## Currency 2.0

> [!NOTE]
> By enabling **Currency 2.0**, you can select a currency for each individual report if you prefer not to use **USD** as the default currency. The report will show all the monetary fields in your report using the selected currency. For example, if you select **Advertiser**, click the **Currency 2.0** toggle to enable it, and select **Japanese Yen (JPY)** from the **Currency** menu, the report will show all monetary data in JPY, including data associated with child objects such as line items.

## Dimensions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Filter?** column shows whether a dimension can be used as a filter as well as being used to group by.
>
> Some dimensions have *attributes*. Dimension attributes are a more granular element of data about the parent dimension. If a dimension has attributes, the name of its attributes will appear below it using the following syntax: *Dimension_Name:Attribute_Name*
>
>For all revenue fields, the currency is defined by the **Buying Currency** field (When Currency 2.0 is disabled).

## To run your report

Follow these steps to run your report.

1. Select **Reporting** from the appropriate top menu (depending on how your account has been
    configured).
    1. Or, from the Publishers top menu, click on **Prebid Server Premium &gt; Analytics &gt; Prebid Server Analytics**
1. Select the relevant report from the list. The **Report** screen shows the available filters, dimensions, and delivery options for the report. The selections you make here will determine what report data is delivered to you, and how.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For an explanation of how grouping and filtering work, see [Dimensions, Metrics, Filtering, and Grouping](dimensions-metrics-filtering-and-grouping.md).

1. Select the relevant filters to limit the data displayed to just the information you want. For example, rather than running a report that shows impressions for all inventory sources, you may want to list results for just a select few. When you select a filter (by clicking **Edit**), a selection panel appears. Select items in the **Available** list (left), then click **Add** to include them in the **Chosen** list (right).
1. Group by Dimension. Grouping allows you to display rows of data in
    the order you prefer.

    > [!WARNING]
    > The more dimensions you group by, the larger the data set that is returned. Larger data sets can take substantially longer to process. Be sure to group using only the dimensions you need.

1. Choose a delivery option. Once you've selected your filters and grouped by your chosen dimensions, you need to choose a delivery
    method. Available delivery methods include:
    - **Run now, show results in screen**: For smaller amounts of data, you may want to view the report as soon as possible in your
      browser. You can download the report in XLSX, CSV, Excel/TSV and JSON format. However, there is a limit of 100,000 rows per report
      when downloading as XLSX and Excel file.
    - **Run in background, notify me when results are ready to view**: A popup notification will let you know when the report is ready to
      view or download.

      > [!TIP]
      > The maximum size of the report that can be downloaded from the UI is 100 MB. Also, there is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when downloading as XLSX and Excel file. If the size of the report is more than that, you can try to download it using the [API](../digital-platform-api/report-service.md) for that reporting service (The limit here is 10 million rows).

    - **Export, send results via email**: Run the report in the background and email the results to one or more email addresses.
    - **Save as report template**: Save your selected report settings so that you can run this report again in the future. You can name
      this template using the text entry field under **Name this report** (its checkbox is auto-selected when you choose this option). A saved report can be rerun from the **Your Reports** screen.
    - **Add to scheduled reports**: Run this report automatically at specified times and have it sent to one or more email addresses.
    - **Name this report**: Give this report with its current settings a name for future reference.
1. Click **Run report** to send your report request.
