# Microsoft Invest - Managing notification recipients

From the Member menu, you can control who receives email notifications from Microsoft Advertising for various alerts, including creative audit, object limit, inventory deactivation, and toolbar flag alerts using your notification settings.

> [!TIP]
> If you need multiple team members to receive notifications, you might want to create an email list that you can manage internally and use a single address for notification emails. For example, `notification@yourcompany.com` could include multiple internal team members, and you could adjust notification recipients by adding them to, or removing them from, the main `notification@yourcompany.com` list. You wouldn't have to make any additional changes within your notification settings.

## Safety budget

For setting recipients for daily safety budget notifications, see [Capping Daily Spend on Third-Party Inventory (Safety Budget)](capping-daily-spend-on-third-party-inventory-safety-budget.md).

## Audit notification

Enter the recipients who should receive a notification when Microsoft Advertising audits a creative belonging to this member. The notification includes the creative's audit status and any reasons why the creative has not passed audit.

## Sherlock and object limit notification

Enter the recipients who should receive a notification when Sherlock scans a creative belonging to this member. The notification includes the creative's audit status and any reasons why the creative has not passed audit. For more information, see [Sherlock: Creative Quality Control](sherlock-creative-quality-control.md).

These recipients will also receive object limit notifications, sent when you reach 85, 95, and 100 percent of your limit for an object. For more information, see [Viewing Your Object Limits](viewing-your-object-limits.md).

## Inventory deactivation & toolbar flag notification

Enter the recipients who should receive a notification when Microsoft Advertising identifies invalid traffic or toolbar inventory. The notification will include information about the kind of invalid traffic or what non ad-supported or Owned & Operated domains your tag served on.
