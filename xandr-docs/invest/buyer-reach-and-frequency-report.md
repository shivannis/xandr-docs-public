# Microsoft Invest - Buyer Reach and Frequency report

The Buyer Reach and Frequency Report holds two parameters as reach which is the number of unique devices or persons exposed to ads and frequency which is the average number of times each unique device or person was exposed to advertisements. It helps to draw meaningful conclusions about the impact of cross device on conversion use cases. In short, buyers can have an insight on how cross device impacted the number of times a single person saw their ads across all their devices using this report.

## Metrics

> [!NOTE]
> When values of a metric are displayed as percentages in the UI, they will be displayed as decimals when you export the report.

| Column | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| Imps | The total number of impressions. |
| Unique Devices | The total number of unique cookies, mobile or other devices reached by the impressions. |
| Average Impressions per Device | The number of impressions viewed per unique device. |
| Cross Device Incremental Device Reach | The number of unique devices reached due to cross-device audience extension. This metric represents the number of unique devices that are not a part of the targeted segment, but on which impressions were delivered due to a cross device graph being applied, extending the reach to more devices owned by a consumer. |
| Cross Device Incremental Imps | The number of impressions transacted due to cross-device audience extension. This metric represents the number of impressions that were delivered on devices outside the targeted segment(s) for which a cross-device graph was applied, extending the reach to more devices owned by a consumer. |
| Identified Imps | The total number of impressions that included a cookie, device id, or other identifier as part of the ad request. |
| Unidentified Imps | The total number of impressions (i.e. those impressions that did not include a cookie, device id, or other identifier as part of the ad request). |
| Average Impressions Per Identified Device | The number of identified impressions viewed per unique user. |
| Estimated People (**currently available in the US only**) | The estimated number of people reached, deduplicated across the user-specified dimensions. <br/> **Note:** Microsoft Advertising has built a probabilistic data science model to estimate people reach, which is a new metric available in this report. This model considers the unique devices reached at the zip code level, and utilizes publicly available US census data for the total population of each zip code, in order to estimate the number of people reached for that zip code. This zip code level data is then aggregated when a report is pulled in Microsoft Invest so that the buyer can view it at any level of granularity that is provided by the existing dimensions in the report. |

> [!NOTE]
> [Advanced Frequency Management (AFM)](advanced-frequency-management.md), which is currently in **beta**, does not take universal identifier (Universal ID) into account. This is subject to change as the feature would move into GA. Line items utilising Universal ID targeting should avoid using AFM until this is completely adapted.

## To run your report

Follow these steps to run your report.

1. Select **Reporting** from the appropriate top menu (depending on how your account has been configured).
    1. Or, from the Publishers top menu, click on **Prebid Server Premium &gt; Analytics &gt; Prebid Server Analytics**
1. Select the relevant report from the list. The **Report** screen shows the available filters, dimensions, and delivery options for the report. The selections you make here will determine what report data is delivered to you, and how.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For an explanation of how grouping and filtering work, see [Dimensions, Metrics, Filtering, and Grouping](dimensions-metrics-filtering-and-grouping.md).

1. Select the relevant filters to limit the data displayed to just the information you want. For example, rather than running a report that shows impressions for all inventory sources, you may want to list results for just a select few. When you select a filter (by clicking **Edit**), a selection panel appears. Select items in the **Available** list (left), then click **Add** to include them in the **Chosen** list (right).
1. Group by Dimension. Grouping allows you to display rows of data in the order you prefer.

    > [!WARNING]
    > The more dimensions you group by, the larger the data set that is returned. Larger data sets can take substantially longer to process. Be sure to group using only the dimensions you need.

1. Choose a delivery option. Once you've selected your filters and grouped by your chosen dimensions, you need to choose a delivery method. Available delivery methods include:
    - **Run now, show results in screen**: For smaller amounts of data, you may want to view the report as soon as possible in your browser. You can download the report in XLSX, CSV, Excel/TSV and JSON format. However, there is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when downloading as XLSX and Excel file.
    - **Run in background, notify me when results are ready to view**: A popup notification will let you know when the report is ready to
      view or download.

      > [!TIP]
      > The maximum size of the report that can be downloaded from the UI is 100 MB. Also, there is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when downloading as XLSX and Excel file. If the size of the report is more than that, you can try to download it using the [API](../digital-platform-api/report-service.md) for that reporting service (The limit here is 10 million rows).

    - **Export, send results via email**: Run the report in the background and email the results to one or more email addresses.
    - **Save as report template**: Save your selected report settings so that you can run this report again in the future. You can name
      this template using the text entry field under **Name this report** (its checkbox is auto-selected when you choose this option). A saved report can be rerun from the **Your Reports** screen.
    - **Add to scheduled reports**: Run this report automatically at specified times and have it sent to one or more email addresses.
    - **Name this report**: Give this report with its current settings a name for future reference.
1. Click **Run report** to send your report request.
