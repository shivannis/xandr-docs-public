# Microsoft Invest - Create a custom creative template 

You can create a new custom creative template from scratch at any time.

You can also duplicate an existing template and then modify it. For more information, see [Duplicate an Existing Custom Creative Template](duplicate-an-existing-custom-creative-template.md).

1. Navigate to the **Creative Templates** screen by clicking **Creative \> Templates**.
1. Click **New**.
1. Provide the following information:
    1. **Name**: The name of the creative template, which helps buyers identify the creative template when uploading creatives that match this template's media type and format.

       > [!TIP]
       > Be sure to use a name that buyers will easily recognize.

    1. **Media Type** Defines the display style of the creatives that can use the template, such as banner.

    1. **Creative Format**: Defines the creative resource type that can use this template such as Flash, iframe, or External File.

    1. **Template Code**: Specifies how the creative should be rendered.
  
       > [!NOTE]
       > If you include custom macros in the template code, the >must begin with the `#` symbol. If you include standard macros in the template code, they must begin with the `$` symbol. Be sure to replace any hard-coded `adnxs.com` references within the **Template Code** field with the `${XANDR_DOMAIN}` macro to ensure that the appropriate domain (`adnxs.com` or `adnxs-simple.com`) will be used when the auction takes place.

1. To add custom macros, expand the **Custom macros** section if necessary, click **Add Macros**, and do the following.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can add up to 20 custom macros. If the template is being used by any active creatives, you cannot add additional custom macros.

    1. Enter a name for this macro in the **Name** field that buyers will see when they upload creatives that use this template.

        The **Name** field is limited to a maximum of 50 characters.
    1. Select a macro type from the **Type** pull-down menu such as **String** and **True / False**. 

       For example, if you select **True / False**, buyers will see the macro name followed by a checkbox.

    1. If you selected **Select from List**, enter a value for **Option 1**.

        To add more options, click **Add another option** and enter the corresponding value.

    1. If you want to require buyers to complete the macro when uploading new creatives that use this template, click the **Required** checkbox.
    1. If you do not want the macro to be required, enter the **Default Value** that will be used when buyers do not complete the macro during creative uploads.
1. Repeat step 4 to add each individual custom macro.
1. Click **Save**.

    The new creative template is active by default and can be applied to new creatives.
