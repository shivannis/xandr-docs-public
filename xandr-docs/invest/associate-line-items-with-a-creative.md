# Associate line items with a creative in Microsoft Invest

When adding a new creative, you can associate existing line items to it,
which will cause the creative to automatically appear in the
**Associated Creatives** section of
the **Edit Line Item** screen so that
you don't have to manually associate it at the line item level. After
it's associated, you can schedule when the creative should serve and
apply creative rotation settings to it at the line item level.

Only line items that have been added previously in the system can be
selected from the **Line Item Association** section. You can also use the
**Bulk Edit** menu from the
**Creative Manager** to associate
creatives at the line item level. For more information about associating
creatives with line items, see [Associate
Creatives with a Line Item](associate-creatives-with-a-line-item.md).

1. Enter the partial/full name or ID of the
    existing **Line item** in the Line
    Item text field.
1. Select the appropriate line item from the list
    of results that displays.
