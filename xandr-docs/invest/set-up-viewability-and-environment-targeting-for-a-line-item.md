# Microsoft Invest - Set up viewability and environment targeting for a line item

To narrow your ad campaign's reach to the most valuable inventory, you can set up viewability threshold, device type, system, and page property targeting settings from the **Viewability & Environment Targeting** section for your line item.

To find more detailed instructions for each type of targeting, see the individual topics under [Targeting](buy-side-targeting.md).

## Ad type - Banner

1. If you want to target inventory that has a high probability of being viewable by users, select the checkbox under **Viewability Threshold** and type the threshold percentage in the text box provided. Your line item will only target inventory that has a higher percentage or likelihood of being viewable.

1. If you want to reach users on certain types of devices, select the checkboxes for each **device type** that you plan to target. For more information on device types, see our [Ad Tech Glossary](../industry-reference/online-advertising-and-ad-tech-glossary.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you plan to enable cross-device targeting in the **Audience & Location Targeting** section of the line item, it's a good idea to select more than one device type. For more information, see [Set Up Geography Targeting for a Line Item](set-up-geography-targeting-for-a-line-item.md).

1. If you want to target inventory by operating system, browser, language, device model, or carrier, apply the appropriate system settings to create a list of inventory to include or exclude. If you don't apply specific **System** targeting settings to the line item, all operating systems, browsers, languages, device models, and carriers will be targeted.

1. If you want to target inventory by **page property** (query strings within an ad request) and tag position, apply the appropriate page property targeting settings.

## Ad type - Video

1. If you want to target inventory that has a high probability of being viewable by users, select the checkbox under **Viewability Threshold** and type the threshold percentage in the text box provided.

    Your line item will only target inventory that has a higher percentage or likelihood of being viewable.

1. If you want to target video inventory that is predicted to have a specific rate of completion (in which the consumer plays the entire video), select the checkbox under **Video Completion Rate Threshold** and type the threshold percentage in the text box provided. This checkbox only appears if you have selected **Video** as the ad type in **Basic Settings** section.

    Your line item will only target video inventory that has a higher percentage or likelihood of being viewed to completion.
