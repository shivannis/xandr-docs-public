# Microsoft Invest - Working with conversion pixels

A conversion pixel is used to track user actions in response to an advertiser's creatives, such as registering at a site or making a
purchase. When a conversion pixel fires, we determine if the conversion (the registration, the purchase, etc.) can be "attributed", or tied to the user clicking on or viewing one of the advertiser's creatives previously.

Here's how it works:

1. You create and export a conversion pixel.
1. You ask the advertiser to place the pixel on the page where the user action should be noted, for example, the confirmation page for a registration or the checkout page for a purchase.
1. You associate the conversion pixel to the advertiser's line item(s), where you define the static revenue value that the advertiser will
pay you for attributed conversions. Note that you can also configure to pass an [advanced conversion pixel](conversion-pixels-advanced.md).
1. When the conversion pixel fires, we determine if the user clicked on or viewed one of the advertiser's creatives previously. If so, the
conversion is considered attributed, and you earn the revenue for the conversion defined in the line item.
