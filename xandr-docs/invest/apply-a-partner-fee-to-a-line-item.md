# Microsoft Invest - Apply a partner fee to a line item

You can optionally apply a partner fee to a line item to track third-party costs.

For more information about partner fees, see [Partner Fees](./partner-fees.md).

## Apply a partner fee to a line item

1. Go to the **Fees** section of the line item. Fees required for all of the advertiser's line items are already applied automatically, and are indicated by a lock icon.
1. Click inside the **Associated Fees** search box to see a list of eligible fees, or search for a fee name, and select the desired fee.
1. Mouse over an applied fee to see the full details.
1. Click **Review and Save**.

## Remove a partner fee from a line item

1. Go to **Line Items** > **Fees**.
1. Click the **X** in the label for the fee you'd like to remove.

> [!NOTE]
> If a fee is required for all line items, you will not be able to remove the fee from a line item. If you decide you do not want the fee to apply to a line item after all, you must first make the partner fee optional on the Member level and then remove the fee from the line item. For more information on managing partner fees on the Member level, see [Manage Partner Fees](./manage-partner-fees.md).
