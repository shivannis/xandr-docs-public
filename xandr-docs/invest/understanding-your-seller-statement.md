# Microsoft Invest - Understanding your seller statement

As a member who sells inventory on Microsoft Advertising's
platform, you receive a monthly statement indicating the amount of revenue you have earned. This page explains the three types of seller statements. Your contract terms define the type of statement you will receive.

> [!NOTE]
> Your statement is delivered in your default currency. Although all transactions are recorded in US dollars, those dollar amounts are converted to your default currency (at the end of the the activity period reflected in the statement). Microsoft Advertising uses the Reuters conversion rate at the end of the activity period to prepare your statement. We also account for hedging cost as per your contract. The amounts on your statement are converted by multiplying the US dollar amount by the conversion rate less the hedging cost.

> [!NOTE]
> If you selling activity incurs ad serving charges and/or your contracted terms with Microsoft Advertising has the Seller Auction Service Charge set as a Fee instead of a Deduction, you will also receive an invoice from Microsoft Advertising. For details on seller-specific charges that can appear on an invoice, see [Understanding Your Invoice](understanding-your-invoice.md).

## Seller activity statement

This document provides you with seller revenue earned during the prior
month. You can view the supporting data by running the Selling Billing
Report in the UI. Your Seller Activity Statement will be automatically
emailed to the individual within your organization who is responsible
for seller activity. If you have any questions, contact
Microsoft Advertising Client Finance: [billing@xandr.com](mailto:billing@xandr.com).

Here's an example of what a what a typical seller statement looks like:

## Seller remittance statement

This document lists the amount of revenue due to be paid, along with any adjustments. The total difference between the revenue and adjustments is the amount you will be paid on the referenced payment cycle date. Sellers typically gather revenue information by using the Selling Billing Report.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Payment Cycle** date indicated on the Seller Remittance Statement is the date that Microsoft Advertising will release the payment from our banking institution, not the date that it is received by the Seller. Remittance statements are available from within the UI when payment is made. If no statement is available when an expected payment is made,please reach out to Microsoft Advertising Client Finance: [billing@xandr.com](mailto:billing@xandr.com).

## Netting statment

> [!NOTE]
> You only receive a Netting Statement if you conduct both buying and selling activity with Microsoft Advertising, have contractually agreed to netting and notified the Client Finance team to enable netting for your account.

 This monthly document lists the amount of revenue you have earned as a seller as well as your activity as a buyer. Microsoft Advertising then deducts the amount that you owe as a buyer from the revenue you have earned as a seller to determine the amount you will be paid or that you owe.

To have newly added seats included in your netting calculation, contact
Client Finance: [billing@xandr.com](mailto:billing@xandr.com).

1. **Client Information** - This includes the client name and address.

1. **Payment Terms** - Your seller payment terms followed by your
    invoice (buyer) payment terms, as specified in the Payment Terms section of your Microsoft Advertising Service Exhibit.
    Standard netting terms are 30 days for buyers to pay
    Microsoft Advertising and 60 days for Microsoft Advertising to pay sellers. As a result, your netting statement will offset seller activity with buyer activity (both from the previous month).

    activity period. In the example below, the statement includes seller

    within the seller period.
