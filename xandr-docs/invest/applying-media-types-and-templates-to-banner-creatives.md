# Microsoft Invest - Applying media types and templates to banner creatives

You can apply media types and standard Microsoft Advertising and custom templates to your banner creatives from the Create New screen.

You can apply the following media types to your banner creatives:

|  Media Type  |                                               Description                                               |
|:-------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Banner       | Static media that typically takes the form of an image.                                                 |
| Interstitial | Transitional media that appears as a user navigates through multiple web pages.                         |
| Expandable   | Rich media that can be enlarged beyond the initial dimensions of the placements they fill on web pages. |
| Skin         | Transformative media that is embedded into the background of a web page.                                |
| High Impact  | Dynamic media that is scalable and contains rich media attributes.                                      |

After selecting the appropriate media type, you can search for and select standard Microsoft Advertising and custom templates. For more information about how to create a custom creative template, see [Create a Custom Creative Template](./create-a-custom-creative-template.md).
