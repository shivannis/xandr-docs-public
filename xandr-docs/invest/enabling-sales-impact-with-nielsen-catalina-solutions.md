# Enabling sales impact for line item delivery with Nielsen Catalina Solutions

If you activate Nielsen's Sales Impact tracking for your line item, you can analyze how your served creatives have influenced physical, in-store product purchases among your target audiences.

Sales Impact through Nielsen Catalina Solutions (NCS) is a measurement capability that advertisers promoting consumer packaged goods can use to understand how their line item delivery is impacting offline sales.

> [!NOTE]
> Sales Impact only works when targeting United States audiences.

Enabling Sales Impact adds a $0.55 CPM fee for served impressions, and you gain access to the [Offline Attribution Report](offline-attribution-report.md), which you can generate at customized intervals. For information on enabling NCS Sales Impact, see [Activate Nielsen Sales Impact for a Line Item](activate-nielsen-sales-impact-for-a-line-item.md).
