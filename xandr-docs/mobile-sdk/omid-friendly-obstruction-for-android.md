# OMID friendly obstruction for Android

## Overview

The Open Measurement Software Development Kit (OM SDK) is designed to facilitate third party viewability and verification measurement for ads served to mobile app environments without requiring multiple Ad Verification Service Providers (Measurement Provider) SDKs.

Open Measurement Interface Definition (OMID) is an open measurement API provided by IAB. In short, it enables a publisher to get data on the viewability of an ad within a mobile device. For more detailed on OMID, visit the IAB site [here](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/open-measurement-sdk/).

The friendly obstructions are the views which OMID will exclude from all viewability calculations when added to the OMID Session. When there is a UI element which needs to be considered as a part of the ad, that can be added as friendly obstructions to prevent it from counting towards coverage of the ad. For example, any native elements such as a close button, some logo text, or other objects which need to be considered as a part of an ad (and not be counted for viewability measurement), should be registered as friendly obstructions. This applies to any ancestor or peer views in the view hierarchy.

The OMID API enables:

- Adding a friendly obstruction
- Removing a friendly obstruction
- Removing all friendly obstructions

The details of these APIs for Android platform for different AdUnits are discussed below:
