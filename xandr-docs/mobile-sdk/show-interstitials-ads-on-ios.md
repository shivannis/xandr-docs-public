# Show Interstitial Ads on iOS

This page has instructions and code samples for showing interstitial ads on iOS.

## Overview

Showing interstitial ads requires a little bit of more effort. In addition to implementing `viewDidLoad` as we did in the banner example, we must implement the `adDidReceiveAd` delegate method. Following section explains about it in details with code samples.

## Process

1. Call `loadAd` to fetch the ad contents from our server and cache them locally. Note that any ad content is rendered in a WebView at the time it is fetched from the ad server and cached. This means that any third-party tracking pixels that are part of the ad content will be fired at the time of the call to `loadAd`, not when the call to `displayAdFromViewController` is made at a later time.
1. When the ad content is actually received from the ad server, your implementation of the `adDidReceiveAd` callback is fired. In the example below, we call `displayAdFromViewController` right away, but your implementation could wait until it's more convenient for your app to show the interstitial ad. Note that the call to `displayAdFromViewController` needs to happen within approximately 4 minutes of the call to `loadAd` in order for the impression to be counted by Xandr. (For the exact timing in milliseconds, see the value of `kANInterstitialAdTimeout` in the source code.)

  > [!NOTE]
  > The close button appears after ten seconds by default. You can set the delay using `ANInterstitialAd.setCloseDelay`.

For more information, see the code sample below.

## Code sample

The interstitial code samples below show how to request ads using the placement ID.

> [!NOTE]
> Beginning with version RC2.8, you can initialize interstitials using a combination of member ID and inventory code instead of placement ID though it is still supported. Here is the method that shows the initialization using inventory code and member ID:

``` 
> // iOS: ObjC code that uses inventory code and member ID instead of placement ID (optional)
-(instancetype)initWithMemberId:(NSInteger)memberId inventoryCode:(NSString *)inventoryCode;
 
```

**Code sample (Objective C)**

``` 
// iOS: ObjC code to show an interstitial ad
#import "ViewController.h"
#import "ANInterstitialAd.h"
@interface ViewController () <ANInterstitialAdDelegate>
@property (nonatomic, strong)ANInterstitialAd *inter;
@end
@implementation ViewController : UIViewController
- (void)viewDidLoad {
    self.inter = [[ANInterstitialAd alloc] initWithPlacementId:@"1326299"];
    
    // set ourselves as the delegate so we can respond to the required adDidReceiveAd
    // message of the `ANAdDelegate protocol' (see implementation below)
    self.inter.delegate = self;
    
    // Load an ad!
    [self.inter loadAd];
}
- (void)adDidReceiveAd:(id<ANAdProtocol>)ad {
    [self.inter displayAdFromViewController:self];
}
- (void)adFailedToDisplay:(ANInterstitialAd *)ad {
    NSLog(@"Uh oh, the ad failed to display!");
}
@end
```

**Code sample (Swift)**

``` 

// iOS: Swift code to show an interstitial ad
// Import ANInterstitialAd.h in the bridging header.
class ViewController: UIViewController, ANInterstitialAdDelegate {
  let inter = ANInterstitialAd.init(placementId: "1326299")
  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    // Set ourselves as the delegate so we can respond to the required adDidReceiveAd
    // message of the ANAdDelegate protocol (see implementation below).
    inter.delegate = self
    // Load an ad!
    inter.loadAd()
  }
  // ANInterstitialAdDelegate
  extension InterstitialViewController: ANInterstitialAdDelegate {
    // - (void)adDidReceiveAd:(nonnull id)ad;
    func adDidReceiveAd(_ ad: Any) {
      appNexusIntersitial?.display(from: self)
    }
    // - (void)ad:(nonnull id)loadInstance didReceiveNativeAd:(nonnull id)responseInstance;
    func ad(_ ad: Any, requestFailedWithError error: Error) {
    }
  }
}
```

## Using custom interstitial sizes

By default, if you don't specify an ad size, the SDK will fetch ads in any of the sizes below that are less than or equal to the size of the device's screen.

- 1x1 (always sent)
- The detected size of the screen (always sent)
- 300x250
- 320x480
- 900x500
- 1024x1024

If you want to show interstitial ads in sizes other than the defaults, set the `allowedAdSizes` property on the `ANInterstitialAd`. Note that the detected size of the screen will still be passed as the main size. The sizes set using the `allowedAdSizes` property will be passed in as `promo_sizes` on the placement and will replace the defaults of 300x250 and 320x480.

## Auto-Close an interstitial

If you want to auto-close an interstitial ad after a specific timeout period, do not call `displayAdFromViewController` as described in the above sections. Instead,call `displayAdFromViewController:(UIViewController *)controller autoDismissDelay:(NSTimeInterval)delay`. The following examples sets the number of seconds the interstitial is displayed before it is closed to 10 seconds.

``` 
// This will show an interstitial ad, wait for 10 seconds, then auto close it.
 [self.interstitial displayAdFromViewController:self autoDismissDelay:10];
```
