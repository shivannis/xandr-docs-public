# Request ads over HTTPS on iOS

> [!NOTE]
> This property is deprecated.

Starting with iOS v2.13 and Android v2.15 of our SDKs, we support requesting ads over HTTPS.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a global setting for the AppNexus SDK. You only need to set this once, and all future ad requests will be sent over HTTPS.
