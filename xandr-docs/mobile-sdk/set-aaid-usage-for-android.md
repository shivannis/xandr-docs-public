# Set AAID usage for Android

## Overview

The Google Advertising ID (AAID) for devices is an Android provided id to track the users for advertising purposes by the publishers who have an app on the Google Play Store (post getting consent from the users to do that). An API is introduced in Xandr mobile SDK to enable or disable AAID usage by including or excluding the AAID field in the ad request. By default, the value is set as **false** for including the AAID field in the AdRequests.

| Property | Type | Attribute | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| `isAAIDUsageDisabled` | boolean | read | To get current status of disableAAIDUsage. |
| `disableAAIDUsage` | boolean | write | To enable/disable the disableAAIDUsage. Default value is **false**. |

## Code sample
```
   /**
    *  An AppNexus disableAAIDUsage is a boolean value, which exclude the AAID field in ad request.
    *  Default value of disableAAIDUsage is set to false
    */
   public static boolean isAAIDUsageDisabled()
   /**
    * Sets true to exclude the AAID field in ad request else false.
    * @param disable whether to disable AAIDUsage or not. default is false
    */
   public static void disableAAIDUsage(boolean disable)
```

## Example

```
// To Set the disableAAIDUsage
SDKSettings.disableAAIDUsage(false);
// To Get the disableAAIDUsage status
SDKSettings.isAAIDUsageDisabled()
```
