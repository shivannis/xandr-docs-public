# API for exiting banner video from fullscreen

When a user presses the back button in an Android device after an outstream video creative (banner ad view) is rendered and sent to full screen mode, the activity with the placement is destroyed and the user is routed to the previous activity in the Activity stack. To mitigate this kind of undesirable situation, Xandr Mobile SDK provides an API, which on pressing of the back button, exits the expanded video creative from full screen mode but keeps the user on the same screen from where the video creative was originated instead of navigating to a previous screen or an unrelated activity.

## Method

### exitFullscreenVideo

This API is applicable only for Outstream Video (rendered using BannerAdView) and ideally this is called from the activity's `onBackPressed()`. This API should be used when the expanded video needs to exit.

```
/**
     * To be called by the developer when the expanded video needs to exit.
     * example: when activity's onBackPressed() function is called.
     */
    public boolean exitFullscreenVideo() {
        if (this.currentDisplayable != null && getAdResponseInfo().getAdType() == AdType.VIDEO) {
            return this.currentDisplayable.exitFullscreenVideo();
        }
        return false;
    }
```

## Example

```
public boolean onBackPressed() {
        if (bav != null) {
            return bav.exitFullscreenVideo();
        }
        return false;
    }
```
