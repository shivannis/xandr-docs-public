# Show banners on iOS

This page has instructions and code samples for showing banner ads. To show banner ads:

1. Include banner ad view header file of mobile SDK.
2. Create a banner ad view object.
3. Pass in a frame, placement ID, and size.
4. Add it as a subview of the current view.

Following the steps mentioned above you should start seeing ads.

The following code samples are simple ones and don't take advantage of all of the capabilities provided by the mobile SDK. For example, you can also pass in the user's age and gender, as well as whether an ad click should open the device's native browser.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use member ID and inventory code instead of a placement ID.
> The banner code sample below shows how to request ads using the placement ID. Beginning with version RC2.8, you can initialize banners using a combination of member ID and inventory code instead (placement ID is still supported). Here are the methods:

``` 
// iOS: ObjC code that uses inventory code and member ID instead of placement ID (optional)
-(instancetype)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame memberId:(NSInteger)memberId inventoryCode:(NSString *)inventoryCode;
-(instancetype)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame memberId:(NSInteger)memberId inventoryCode:(NSString *)inventoryCode adSize:(CGSize)size;

``` 
## Example of use (Objective C)

```
// iOS: ObjC to show a banner ad
#import "ViewController.h"
#import "ANBannerAdView.h"
@interface ViewController ()
@end
@implementation ViewController
- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    // Get the screen size so we can center our 300x50 example ad
    CGRect screenRect = [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds];
    CGFloat centerX = (screenRect.size.width / 2) - 150;
    CGFloat centerY = (screenRect.size.height / 2) - 25;

    // Set up some sizing variables we'll need when we create our ad view
    CGRect rect = CGRectMake(centerX, centerY, 300, 50);
    CGSize size = CGSizeMake(300, 50);

    // Create the banner ad view and add it as a subview
    ANBannerAdView *banner = [ANBannerAdView adViewWithFrame:rect placementId:@"1326299" adSize:size];
    banner.rootViewController = self;
    banner.autoRefreshInterval = 60; // Set to 0 to disable auto-refresh
    [self.view addSubview:banner];
    
// Load an ad!
    [banner loadAd];
}
@end

```

## Example of use (Swift)

``` 
// iOS: Swift to show a banner ad
// Import ANBannerAdView.h in the bridging header.
class MyViewController: UIViewController
{
    override func  viewDidLoad()
    {
        super.viewDidLoad()
 
        // Get the screen size so we can center our 300x50 example ad.
        let  screenRect  = UIScreen.main.bounds
        let  centerX     = (screenRect.size.width / 2) - 150
        let  centerY     = (screenRect.size.height / 2) - 25
 
        // Set up some sizing variables we'll need when we create our ad view.
        let  rect  = CGRect(x:centerX, y:centerY, width:300, height:50)
        let  size  = CGSize(width:300, height:50)
 
        // Create the banner ad view and add it as a subview.
        let  banner  = ANBannerAdView(frame:rect, placementId:"1326299", adSize:size)
        banner.rootViewController = self;
        banner.autoRefreshInterval = 60   // Set to 0 to disable auto-refresh.
        self.view.addSubview(banner)
 
        // Load an ad!
        banner.loadAd()
    }
}
```
