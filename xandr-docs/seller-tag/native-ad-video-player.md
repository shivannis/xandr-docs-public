# Native ad video player

**The Native Ad Video Player** is an implementation of the Xandr Vast Player designed to be used within the Xandr Native Renderer for use with Native Ads.

## Features

The Xandr Vast Player is designed to provide the following features:

- Plays an ad video as delivered in VAST XML.
- You can pass the player the VAST XML in one of the following forms:  
  - URL to a valid VAST XML
  - Direct VAST XML content
- Optionally, displays an pre-show banner image before the ad video plays.
- Optionally, displays a post-show banner image after the ad video plays.
- Optionally, supports a click through if the user clicks on the post-show banner image.
- Optionally, reports a click tracking event if the user clicks on the post-show image.

## API entry point

To get the player to play the native video, you must utilize the `playNativeAdVideo` function. This function passes `targetDiv`, `vast`, `options`, `bannerOptions`, and  `notificationCallback` as arguments.

### Arguments

| Argument | Description | Acceptable Values | Required | Default |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `targetDiv` | The HTML DIV element that contains the ad player. | DIV element that is present on the page. | Yes | None |
| `vast` | String which provides the source of the VAST xml. This can be either the url to the VAST xml or the VAST xml itself.<br>If the VAST xml defines a video ad, then the ad will play. | String that represents one of the following:<br> - A valid URL which will return valid VAST xml.<br> - A VAST xml document. | Yes | None |
| `options` | Contains the set of configuration options for the player. | Javascript object which includes one or more of the supported [Player Options](#player-options) listed below. | Yes, but the object can be empty. | None |
| `bannerOptions` | Contains the set of banner-related options for the video player.<br>You can use any type of image that can be used as a background of a DOM element. | Javascript object which includes one or more the following fields.<br> - `preBanner`  (String) - required - Specifies the url to an image that will be displayed before the video plays.<br><br> - `postBanner`   (String) - optional<br>&nbsp; - Specifies the url to an image that will be displayed after the video plays.<br>&nbsp; - If it is not specified, then the preBanner image will also be displayed after the video plays.<br><br> - `clickUrl`  (String) - optional<br>&nbsp; - Specifies the url to the landing page that will be used when the user clicks on the postBanner image is clicked.<br><br> - `trackingUrl`   (String) - optional<br>&nbsp; - Specifies the tracking url that will be reported when the user clicks on the postBanner image is clicked.<br>&nbsp; - If the clickUrl is not specified, then this option will be ignored. | Yes | None |
| `notificationCallback` | Callback that the player will call with status information about the playback of the ad. | Function which has the prototype defined below in the [Notification Callback](#notification-callback). | No | Undefined |

## How to invoke?

The Xandr Native Ad Renderer should do the following to use the Native Ad Video Player within a native ad:

1. Load the Xandr Vast Player. The Xandr Vast Player will automatically assign the player a variable named `APNVideo_VastVideoPlayer` which will be globally available within the Renderer's document window.
1. Create the div where the player will be located.
1. Construct the set of parameters that need to be passed into the native video player:
    1. A reference to the target div element where the player is located, as create in Step \#2.
    1. Either the url to the target VAST xml or a String containing the VAST xml document itself.
    1. A Javascript object containing the set of player options which control the rendering of the video ad itself. For the list of rendering options supported, see [Player Options](#player-options).
    1. A Javascript object containing the set of banner options to be enforced by the native video player. These include:

          1. `preBanner` - image url (optional).
          1. `postBanner` - image url (optional).
          1. `clickUrl` - landing page when clicking on the postBanner (optional).
          1. `trackingUrl` - tracking url to report the click on the postBanner (optional).
    1. An optional `notificationCallback` function which the player will use to report status.
1. Initiate the Native Ad Video Player by calling the API entry point cited above.

### Example

```
// Code has to be located within same document where the Native Renderer is located
  
// this will load the player and automatically create the APNVideo_VastVideoPlayer variable
var scr = document.createElement('script');
scr.type = 'text/javascript';
scr.src = ‘//acdn.adnxs.com/video/player/vastPlayer/XandrVastPlayer.js’;
document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(scr);
 
 
// once you know that the player has been loaded and you are ready to use it:
var targetDiv = document.getElementById(‘playerContainer’;
var options = {skippable : {enabled: false}};
var vastUrl = ‘http://path-to-my-xml.xml’;
 
var bannerOptions = {};
bannerOptions.preBanner = 'http://my-path-preshow.jpg';
bannerOptions.postBannder = 'http://my-path-postshow.jpg';
bannerOptions.clickUrl = 'http://my-fake-page.com';
bannerOptions.trackingUrl = 'http://my-tracking-url.jpg';
 
APNVideo_VastVideoPlayer.playNativeAdVideo(targetDiv, vastUrl, options, bannerOptions, function(eventCode, data) {console.log ("Native Notified: " + eventCode);});
```

## Player options

Player options are passed into the Xandr Video Player in a Javascript object. The following options are supported:

|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `initialPlayback` | Specifies whether the ad video requires a click to start or whether it should autoplay without a user click.<br><br>**Note:** Most browsers and mobile devices do not permit a video to autoplay with the sound on. Most browsers and devices require a user click if the audio is on. If a browser or device detects that the video is configured to autoplay with sound on, the browser or device will enforce the use of a user click to start the video. | String which can be one of the following:<br>- `auto`: The video will automatically start to play once it is loaded; no user click is needed to start the video.<br> - `click`: The video requires a click to start its playback; usually a play button is displayed inviting the user to click it to start the video. | No | 'click' | `initalPlayback : 'auto'` |
| `initialAudio` | Specifies whether the audio of the ad video is audible at video start or the audio is muted.<br>Users usually have the option to enable the audio if the video starts in a muted state. Users also usually have the option to mute the audio if the video starts with the audio on.<br><br>**Note:** Most browsers and mobile devices do not permit a video to autoplay with the sound on. Most browsers and devices require a user click if the audio is on. If a browser or device detects that the video is configured to autoplay with sound on, the browser or device will enforce the use of a user click to start the video.<br><br>For most click-to-play cases, you would use following settings:<br>`initialPlayback : 'click';`<br>`initialAudio : 'on'`<br>For most autoplay cases, it is recommended that you use:<br>`initialPlayback : 'auto';`<br>`initialAudio : 'off'` | String which can be one of the following:<br>- `on`: The audio of the video will be audible when the video starts.<br> - `off`: The audio of the video will be muted when the video starts. | No | 'on' | `initialAudio: 'off'` |

If the ad video is shorter than this threshold, then NO skip button will be shown. Default value is 15 seconds.<br><br> - `videoOffset` = (number) how long to wait in seconds before showing the skip button. Default value is 5 seconds.<br><br> - `skipLocation` = string specifying the position of the skip button; can be "top-left" (default) or "top-right".<br><br> - `skipText` = (string) text to display announcing the ability to skip the ad; Use %%TIME%% to insert the remaining time.

| `adStartTimeout` | Maximum time in milliseconds that the player will wait for the ad to start. | Number | NO | 5000 | `adStartTimeout: 6000` |
| `adServerTimeout` | Maximum time in milliseconds that the player will wait to retrieve a response when calling an ad server, especially important during the parsing of the VAST xml. <br><br>**Note:**  `adServerTimeout`  should not be greater than the value for  `adStartTimeout`. If you need to greatly increase the limit for  `adServerTimeout`  to greater than the default value for  `adStartTimeout`, then you should also increase the value of  `adStartTimeout`. | Number | No | 2000 | `adServerTimeout: 4000` |
