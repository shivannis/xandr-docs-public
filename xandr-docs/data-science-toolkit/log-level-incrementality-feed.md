# Data Science Toolkit - Log-level incrementality feed

The Log-Level Incrementality Feed provides data on impressions shown to an audience randomly split between a test group (the group exposed to ads) and control group (the group not exposed to ads). The test uses the same targeting and bidding approach for each group so that advertisers can analyze the revenue driven by users from each group to determine incremental lift from users exposed to ads. The feed contains one row per impression.

## Incrementality in Console UI (required)

1. In Xandr's UI, go to **Line Item** > **Basic Setup** > **Incrementality** and select **“Use control group”**.
1. Assign a key and a percentage of traffic to assign to the control group.

## Sequence

The [Columns](#columns) below are listed in the same order in which they appear in the log-level feed file (top to bottom here, left to right in the file).

## Data visibility and `"NULL"` values

All columns are always included, but you can only see data for which you have permission. Columns that are not visible will be shown as `"NULL"`.

`"NULL"` may be returned in cases when:

- The seller on the impression has visibility settings that hide the value of that field from buyers (assuming you are a buyer in this transaction).
- The data is not available.

## Recommended precisions/lengths of data types

In the [Columns](#columns) table below, some values in the Type column contain a recommended precision or length in parentheses. For example `string(100)` means "this string is probably (but not guaranteed to be) less than or equal to 100 characters in length".

For integers, the sizes are described in the [Integer Key](#integer-key) section.

For `numeric` (floating point) data types, we recommend being able to accept a precision of (18,6), meaning that we expect there to be a maximum total of 18 digits: 12 to the left of the decimal point, and 6 to the right.

For `string` data types, the recommended length of the field varies depending on the field. See the table below.

> [!NOTE]
> These are Recommendations, not Guarantees.
>
> The data types are meant to be accurate as documented. However, the recommended precision or length for a given data type should not be read as a guarantee. For example, a string or numeric column's value may exceed the suggested length or precision listed on this page.
>
> The recommendations are intended to help you build your system to ingest this data. You may need to do additional processing on the output of the Standard Feed to make it work with your particular integration.
