# Managing your targeting lists

> [!NOTE]
> Targeting lists are only available to Standard Line Items. For an overview of which targeting options are available to Standard versus Augmented Line items, see [Buy-Side Targeting](buy-side-targeting.md).

The **Targeting Lists** screen allows you to create domain lists or app lists. These are used to target websites by domain or mobile apps, respectively. You can use these lists to quickly set up targeting for campaigns. You can create, view, update, or delete lists using this screen.

For details about including or excluding targeting lists from a campaign, see [App Targeting](app-targeting.md).

## Choosing a list

1. Select **Network**\> **Inventory** \> **Targeting** Lists from the top navigation menu.
1. In the **Targeting Lists** section, you'll find the **Domain Lists** and **App Lists** tabs. Select either tab to display its corresponding lists.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Domain targeting applies only to **Web** and **Mobile Web** impressions and does not apply to **Mobile App** impressions. If you have allowed your campaign to serve on mobile apps while targeting a domain list, the campaign will be unrestricted when buying mobile app inventory unless you have also applied **App List** targeting. To avoid serving on mobile app inventory, switch the **Apps Placements** toggle in your campaign's targeting profile to **OFF**.

## Actions on lists

- To create a new list, click **+ New**.
- To view, update, or remove a targeting list, click on the checkbox next to that list and select an action from the **Actions** drop-down menu. For more detailed instructions, see the **Related Topics** section below.

## Actions on individual list items

If you'd like to work on the individual domains or apps in a list directly, click on the name of the targeting list to open a new window that displays the individual domains or apps on that list.

- To create a new domain or app in the list, click **+ New**.
- To view, update, or remove an item on the targeting list, click on the checkbox next to that item and select an action from the **Actions** drop-down menu. For more detailed instructions, see the **Related Topics** section below.
