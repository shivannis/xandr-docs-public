> This feature is currently in **Alpha**. It is still under development and may be subjected to changes without notice. Contact your Microsoft Advertising Account Representative to get it enabled.

The **Seller Pod Analytics** report shows metrics for groups of ads (aka pods) delivered sequentially in between segments of non-commercial video programming.

You can use this report to determine the following:

- The number of pods that were sent for Monetization
- The average number of impressions sold per pod
- The average estimate of revenue per pre-roll in comparison to mid-roll pod
- The average seconds sold per pod
- The fill rate in seconds
- The number of opportunities to serve impressions if a pod was unfilled

## Timeframe

All dates and times are given in UTC.

The `report_interval` field in the JSON request can be set to one of the following:

- Custom
- Today
- Yesterday
- Last 7 Days(not including today)
- Month to Date
- Last Month
- Quarter to Date

To run a report for a custom time frame, set the `Start Date` and `End Date` fields in your report request. For more details about these
fields, see [Report Service](../bidders/report-service.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The timestamp this report uses is the hour that Microsoft Advertising received the ad request for the pod. It means that if a pod was requested at hour 05 and impressions rendered at hour 07, then the pod count, impressions, and video events will report together at hour 05. It means pods that playback cross-hour boundaries are reported in the same hour, and it ensures metrics such as impressions per pod are calculated accurately on pre-cached integrations.

## Intervals

Intervals determine how your data is grouped together into rows in the report response. The following is a complete list of intervals available for reports. However, all intervals are not available for every report.

- Hourly: Data is grouped into rows by the hour.
- Daily: Data is grouped into rows by the day.
- Monthly: Data is grouped into rows by the month.

When you select a filter (by clicking **Edit**), a selection panel appears. Select items in the **Available** list (left), then click **Add** to include them in the **Chosen** list (right).
1. Group by Dimension. Grouping allows you to display rows of data in the order you prefer.

    > [!WARNING]
    > The more dimensions you group by, the larger the data set that is returned. Larger data sets can take substantially longer to process. Be sure to group using only the dimensions you need.

1. Choose a delivery option. Once you've selected your filters and grouped by your chosen dimensions, you need to choose a delivery method. Available delivery methods include:
