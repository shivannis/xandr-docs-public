# Monetize insights for total revenue

The **Total Revenue** tab of
**Monetize Insights** offers a
convenient method for monitoring business performance and key
performance indicators (KPIs), such as:

- Revenue
- Impressions
- Ad Requests
- Fill Rate
- Win Rates

Analyzing trends and significant changes is made easy by dissecting the
data based on different dimensions, such as:

- Channel
- Buyer,
- DSP
- Brand
- Publisher
- Placement Group

Users can customize the screens with filters, specific to an inventory
or demand pertinent to their roles. Delving further into the data is a
straightforward process, simply click on the table to reveal specific
metrics for the selected criteria.

## Navigation bar, global filters and date selection

The Navigation bar located at the top of the
**Insights** page allows you to
seamlessly switch between **Total
Revenue**, offering a comprehensive view of KPIs and trends across
all channels, and individual channels. At the global level, you can
apply filters that will be effective across all tabs in
**Insights**, in addition to choosing
specific date ranges, with the flexibility to select a date range
spanning up to 31 days ago, and an option to compare it to the
immediately preceding time period, as far back as 62 days ago. The data
is presented with a daily granularity in the UTC time zone, and the most
recent data available corresponds to the prior day once the processing
for that day is completed.

breakdown of metrics organized by a specific dimension, such as
Publisher. This layout facilitates a clear understanding of the
individual components contributing to the top-line metrics. You can
modify the dimension by utilizing the "**View
By**" button located at the top right of the section. The top 6
records are displayed for the selected view, while the remaining entries
are grouped under "**Other**." The
chart's display can be toggled between an area trend chart and a bar

## Drill down on the side panel

Clicking on a row in the detailed table will open a side panel, allowing
for a quick exploration of the chosen dimension. For example, a
particular brand selected, can reveal details such as revenue
impressions, CPM, the percentage of total revenue, and the number of
unique buyers associated with that particular brand. Subsequently, a
comparative chart is displayed, followed by a detailed chart and table,
all offering the same functionality as the main window.

## Fidelity of data

Data within **Insights** is presented
at a daily granularity in the (UTC) timezone and is updated daily to
reflect data from the previous day (UTC). Adjustments for fixed-fee
managed line items made on the same day are considered, but adjustments
occurring at the end of a multi-day flight are not retrospectively
applied. Metric totals are processed to align with reporting figures,
with the exception of the brand dimension, which serves as an indicative
measure for identifying anomalies.

For the brand dimension, data is processed to reduce data fidelity on
long-tail transactions where the daily revenue from a brand on a
specific placement is less than $5. In this scenario the revenue,
impressions and CPM will be attributed to a category labeled
"**Below Threshold**." For precise
metrics by brand, it is recommended to utilize reporting tools rather
than relying solely on Insights.
