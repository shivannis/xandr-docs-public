# Microsoft Monetize - Vendor usage report UI

**Release date**: January 18, 2022

A new report in UI, the **Vendor Usage Report**, provide details related to the usage of data or platform powered by third party vendors (e.g., user segment providers), the costs of that data or feature usage, and the line items/campaigns where vendor costs were applicable. The report introduces two new costs as **Feature Cost** and **Segment Data Cost**. This report is an enhanced version of the current **Data Usage Report** (which will be deprecated on January 31, 2022).

For more information, see [Vendor Usage Report](vendor-usage-report.md).
