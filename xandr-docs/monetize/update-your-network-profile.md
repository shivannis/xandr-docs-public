# Update your network profile

A Network Profile is a collection of ad quality settings that is created
by a network administrator. These rules are applied to every impression
across all publishers associated with a network.

There is no need to create a Network Profile, they are created
automatically for each member.

Restrictions set in a Network Profile will apply to all publishers, even
if those publishers have their own custom profiles. In other words,
publisher-level settings can only be more strict than the Network
Profile, never less. For more information about publisher templates, see [Create a Publisher Template](create-a-publisher-template.md).

## Step 1. Update your network profile

Depending on your menu options, click **Ad Quality** from either the
**Network** menu or the
**Inventory** menu.

Click to expand the attribute section you want to update (Buyers,
Brands, Categories, Technical Attributes, Languages, Frequency Caps).
Within each section you'll see a list corresponding to that attribute.
(For example, under the **Buyers** section
you'll see a list of buyers.) You can scroll through the list, search
for a particular attribute, or filter for a specific set of attributes.

Once you find the attribute you want to update, you can set eligibility
on that attribute (see Step 2). You can also set the default for all
attributes within a section.

To set the default, click the default option in the upper right corner
of the section. For example, to set the default for buyer trust, click
the pencil icon next to **Default buyer trust** in the top right corner
of the Buyers section:

## Step 2. Determine which creatives are eligible to serve on your inventory

You can determine which creatives will be eligible to serve on your
inventory based on one or more of the following attributes:

- Bidders
- Buyers
- Brands
- Categories
- Technical Attributes
- Languages
- Ad Servers
- Frequency Caps

**Bidders**

You can manage bidders and individual bidder seats that serve on your
inventory by defining trust level settings here. Choose from the trust level given in the table below:

| Trust Level | Description |
|---|---|
| Banned | Ban all creatives from this buyer. |
| High | Bypass ad quality standards, require platform audit. |
| Maximum | Bypass ad quality standards, do not require platform audit. |
| Medium | Apply ad quality standards, trust buyer self-classification. |
| Standard | Apply ad quality standards, require platform audit. |

The bidders and their seats are mapped to the existing buyer IDs, and
all trust settings are inherited by both. Updating trust settings to
either one of the sections (Buyers or Bidders) will update trust
settings for the same bidder or seat in both sections.

> [!NOTE]
> Updating the trust level for Bidders will apply the same trust level to all Seats. However, Bidder trust can be overridden by updating Seat-level trust settings from **Use Bidder** to another trust level.

The default trust setting for Bidders is inherited from the Buyers
section and any adjustments to the trust settings should be made in the
Buyer’s section. To know more about Buyer Seat IDs, see: [Understanding Buyer Seat IDs](understanding-buyer-seat-ids.md)

**Buyers**

Click in the **Buyers** section to expand
that section. The buyer trust levels and their descriptions are as
follows:

| Trust Level | Description |
|---|---|
| Banned | Ban all creatives from this buyer. |
| High | Bypass ad quality standards, require platform audit. |
| Maximum | Bypass ad quality standards, do not require platform audit. |
| Medium | Apply ad quality standards, trust buyer self-classification. |
| Standard | Apply ad quality standards, require platform audit. |

You can also choose the **Use Default**
option. To set the default, click the pencil icon next to
**Default buyer trust** or
**Direct advertiser trust** in the top
right corner of the **Buyers** section.

**Brands**

There may be creatives associated with certain brands that you would
prefer don't serve on your inventory. You can define those settings
here. Choose from the following:

- **Eligible**: The creative will serve.
- **Banned**: The creative will not serve.
- **Use Default**: Reuse the default
  settings. (You can modify the default by clicking the pencil icon next
  to **Default brand eligibility** in the
  top right corner of the section.)

> [!NOTE]
> If a brand is marked as **Eligible**, creatives associated with this brand will serve even if the brand's category is **Banned**. For example, if you mark the brand "1 and 1 Internet (17310)" as **Eligible** it will serve even if you ban its overall category, "Telecommunications (27)".

To find specific brands to modify you can do a search for brands
matching a specific pattern (such as all brands containing "media" in
the name) or you can bulk search, entering the names of each brand you
want to modify. You can also filter on whether a brand is currently
marked as eligible or banned. If you want to see only brands that were
added after a certain date, click in the
**Created after date** box and select a
date. To see all brands created in the past seven days, click
**nnn new since yyyy-mm-dd** next to the
**Brands** section heading.

**Categories**

Depending upon the category the creative falls into, you may choose to
mark it as one of the following:

- **Eligible**: The creative will serve.
- **Banned**: The creative will not serve.
- **Default**: Reuse the default settings.
  (You can modify the default by clicking the pencil icon next to
  **Default category eligibility** in the
  top right corner of the section.)

> [!WARNING]
> **Sell-side content category targeting limitations**
> 
> Content categories must be set at both the placement group and placement level in order for sell-side targeting of content categories to work consistently. This affects yield management and ad quality settings. This limitation applies only to content categories (both custom and universal), not to other inventory attributes.

**Technical attributes**

You may allow or disallow certain creatives based upon technical
attributes such as whether the creative is an expandable, or whether it
plays audio. Choose from:

- **Eligible**: The creative will serve.
- **Banned**: The creative will not serve.
- **Default**: Reuse the default settings.
  (You can modify the default by clicking the pencil icon next to
  **Default technical attribute
  eligibility** in the top right corner of the section.)

**Languages**

Your inventory may interest users who speak certain languages; you can
choose to allow creatives using those languages here. You may also
exclude creatives based on language. Choose from:

- **Eligible**: The creative will serve.
- **Banned**: The creative will not serve.
- **Default**: Reuse the default settings.
  (You can modify the default by clicking the pencil icon next to
  **Default language eligibility** in the
  top right corner of the section.)

**Ad Servers**

> [!NOTE]
> This option is available only to some Publisher Adserver customers.

You can choose to serve only those creatives that are hosted on a
specific set of ad server domains. All ad servers are eligible by
default, but you can change the default by clicking the pencil icon next
to **Default ad server eligibility** in
the top right corner of the section.

Choose from the following settings:

- **Eligible**: The creative will serve.
- **Banned**: The creative will not serve.
- **Default**: Reuse the default settings.
  (You can modify the default by clicking the pencil icon next to
  **Default language eligibility** in the
  top right corner of the section.)

See [Ad Server Settings](ad-server-settings.md)
for information on using the Ad Server
screen to create collections of eligible or banned ad servers.

## Step 3. Apply frequency caps to attributes

You can apply per-user frequency caps to particular creatives based on
one or both of the following attributes:

- **Sensitive Categories**: The creative may belong to a sensitive
  category such as "Dating" or "Politics".
- **Technical Attributes**: The creative may have undesirable technical
  attributes, such as whether it plays audio.

By default frequency caps are turned off, in which case you'll see
**No limit per user** in the upper right
corner of the section. To change this, click
**No limit per user**. (If frequency caps
have already been set, this area will show the frequency, such as **2
imps per day**, rather than **No limit per user**.) This will expand an
area where you can set the frequency caps for the attributes and
categories to which they're applied.

For more information on frequency caps, see [Frequency and Recency Caps](frequency-and-recency-caps.md).
