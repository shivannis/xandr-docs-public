# Microsoft Monetize - Edit default buyer settings

<!--You can set the eligibility, allowed payment types, and targeting access for buyers within the **Partner Center** screen or in the **Partner Controls** tab.-->
This article explains about the updates you can make to the default buyer settings within the **Partner Center** screen or in the **Partner Controls** tab. The **Partner Controls** tab is also visible to the buyer. They can see what you have exposed to and hidden from them. Your default settings will apply if you do not set custom settings for the buyer.

> [!NOTE]
> While you can manage these settings in the **Partner Center** and in the **Partner Controls** tab, you can only view the buyer's current settings in the **Partner Controls** tab.
> [!TIP]
> For more information about the settings described on this page, see [Set default buyer settings](set-default-buyer-eligibility-allowed-payment-types-and-targeting-access.md).

## Edit a single buyer's settings

Follow the steps below to edit a buyer's settings.

### Step 1. Get started

Go to the **Partnership Details** screen (**Partner Center**, then click on a buyer's name) and click on the **Partner Controls** tab.

Then click **Edit** to make the settings editable.

### Step 2. Update buyer eligibility

Select the eligibility you would like to apply to the buyer. This setting indicates whether your inventory is available (Eligible) to the buyer, or not (Blocked). Choose **Default** in the dropdown if you want your default setting to continue to apply to the buyer. When **Default** is selected, the current default setting displays for reference.

### Step 3. Update allowed payment types

Select the payment types you are willing to accept from the buyer. Choose **Default** in the dropdown if you want your default setting to continue to apply to the buyer. When **Default** is selected, the current default setting displays for reference. Otherwise, choose **Custom** in the dropdown and check the checkbox near CPA and/or CPC in addition to CPM.

> [!NOTE]
> The only allowed deal type for external buyers is CPM.

### Step 4. Update targeting access

Select the information that should be exposed to the buyer when they are targeting your inventory. Choose **Default** in the dropdown if you want your default settings to continue to apply to the buyer. When **Default** is selected, the current default setting displays for reference. Otherwise, choose **Custom** in the dropdown and then check the checkbox near the desired settings to allow access to URL, category, age, gender, placement, or publisher targeting information. The more information you give the buyer, the more #easily they can target your inventory.

You will have the option to expose domains or full URLs to external buyers.

Age and gender targeting information can only be shared if you include the Microsoft Advertising age and gender macro when exporting your placement tag. For more information, see [Export Placement Tags](export-placement-tags.md).

For **Categories (Custom)**, there is the additional option to expose specific categories. To select specific custom categories, choose **Expose Custom** and then click **Edit** to display the list of custom categories. Click on a category in the **Available Items** area to add it to the **Selected Items** area. To remove a category from the
Selected Items area, click on the X next to the category name. When you have finished selecting custom categories, click **Add** to save your changes.
