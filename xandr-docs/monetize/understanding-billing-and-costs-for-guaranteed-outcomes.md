# Microsoft Monetize - Billing and costs for Guaranteed Outcomes

Guaranteed Outcomes currently only covers a buyer's media cost, which is accrued on a per-outcome basis. Additional impression-based CPM costs may still apply, particularly if those fees are billed outside of Microsoft Advertising. For example, an ad serving fee may be charged on a CPM basis, regardless of the outcome of a given impression.

Sometimes, depending on the type of rate being applied, data costs may be incurred by non-viewable impressions. If the rate for the data provider is CPM-based, the data cost is charged on all impressions, including non-viewable impressions or non-completed video plays. However, if the rate for the data provider is based on a percentage of media cost, data costs are only incurred on completed views or impressions. In this case, non-viewable impressions incur zero data charges.
