# Working with campaigns

Once you have created a line item to define your financial agreement with an advertiser, you can set up campaigns to buy media based on your agreement. Setting up a campaign involves defining how much you are willing to spend (media budget), whether you want to buy both direct, third-party, or both types of inventory, how you want to bid (buying strategies), and how you want to target inventory and users.

- [Explore Campaigns](explore-campaigns.md): View essential metrics about all campaigns under an advertiser or
  under a specific line item, find out about conditions preventing campaigns from serving, get quick access to each campaign's details, and use bulk editing and reporting options.
