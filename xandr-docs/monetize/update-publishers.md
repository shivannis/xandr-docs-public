# Update publishers

You can update publishers in the Microsoft Advertising system.
Follow the steps in the appropriate section to modify your publishers.
All of these actions happen from the
**Publishers** screen in
Monetize.

## Edit a publisher

To edit an existing publisher, first highlight the line of the publisher
you want to edit (this is different than checking the checkbox). The
**Publisher Details** section appears at
the bottom of the screen. To change any settings for that publisher,
click the **Edit** button.(For details on
the specific settings, see [Create a Publisher](create-a-publisher.md).)

From the **Publishers** screen you can
move on to edit or view a publisher's components, such as placements, ad
quality, and reporting. Click on the
**Publishers** menu and select the
component from the dropdown menu. This will open a dialog box from which
you can select the publisher. Alternatively, from the
**Publishers** screen, click on or
hover over the publisher you want to work with. Select the component
from the **Go to** menu for that
publisher.

## Activate/Deactivate publishers

To change the state of one or more publishers to active or
inactive, check the checkbox next to the publisher(s) you want to
change.After at least one publisher has been checked,the options in the
**Actions** dropdown become active. Select
**Activate** or
**Deactivate** as appropriate. A
confirmation dialog appears. Click
**Confirm** and all selected publishers
will be updated. Use the state dropdown to display publishers based on
this status.

## Delete a publisher

This is particularly useful when you want to get rid of unnecessary or
accidentally created publishers.

> [!WARNING]
> Before you proceed, you should confirm that the publisher you are deleting is not actively involved in any current campaign activity. Also, please note that deleting a publisher deletes **all** of its child objects as well, including placement groups, placements, payment rules, and publisher-level ad quality profiles. The deletions are permanent and cannot be reverted. Although deleted objects continue to be available in reporting, you will no longer have visibility into their specific settings.

Delete publishers by first checking the box next to each publisher you
want to delete. Select **Action** \> **Delete**. A confirmation dialog
will appear. Click **Confirm** to delete
all selected publishers.
