  The [Network Analytics Report](network-analytics-report.md) lets you view deal performance, revenue, and profit data across multiple advertisers.
- **Advertiser Analytics**  
  The [Advertiser Analytics Report](advertiser-analytics-report.md) lets you view deal performance, revenue, and profit data for a specific advertiser.
- **Network Site Domain Performance**  
  The [Network Site Domain Performance Report](network-site-domain-performance-report.md) lets you see the domains that deals are serving on across multiple advertisers.
- **Advertiser Site Domain Performance**  
  The [Advertiser Site Domain Performance report](site-domain-performance.md) lets you see the domains that deals are serving on for a specific advertiser.
- **Partner Center Reporting Link**  
  The [Show in Reporting](partnership-details-screen-buyer-view.md) button provides a link between managing your deals in the Partner Center and checking on deal performance in the [Network Analytics Report](network-analytics-report.md).
