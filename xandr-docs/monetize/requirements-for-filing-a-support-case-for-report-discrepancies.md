# Microsoft Monetize - Requirements for filing a support case for report discrepancies

To file a case exploring a possible report discrepancy with Product
Support, you need to gather reports, including object IDs for the
relevant objects, and create a spreadsheet that shows a discrepancy
greater than 10% (15% for mobile).

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Make sure the discrepancy occurred within the last 90 days. | This requirement guarantees Microsoft Advertising can confirm the discrepancy, given that data retention policies vary. |
| Provide a spreadsheet (.csv or .xls) that includes both Microsoft Advertising and the third party's reporting data. You'll use this spreadsheet to demonstrate the discrepancy, which must be greater than 10% (or 15% for mobile apps) | Use this equation to calculate the discrepancy percentage:<br> - (1 - (Microsoft Advertising's Report Metric/3rd-Party Report's Metric)) x 100 |
| Provide all the object IDs relevant to the discrepancy and their mappings, so Microsoft Advertising support can clearly identify the correspondence between the objects in each report. | For example, provide the advertiser ID, insertion order ID, creative ID(s), line item ID, seller ID, placement ID, and others. |
| Provide the reports from both Microsoft Advertising and the third party. | Ensure both reports:<br> - contain data from the same time frame.<br> - use the same time zone<br>**Note**: UTC is the preferred time zone for submitting reports.<br> - share the same methods for counting impressions and/or clicks<br> - specify which objects (campaign, placement, advertiser, or line item, for example) you're pulling data from<br> - include objects that clearly correspond with each other in the Microsoft Advertising and third-party reports<br>**Note**: The Microsoft Advertising IDs of these objects must be noted in the Microsoft Advertising report. |
