# Ad server settings

You can set your Ad Quality settings to limit creatives served on your property based on the ad servers associated with the creative. In this context an ad server is determined to be any technology vendor that is in a creative's call chain. We associate a vendor to a creative when we see a matching hostname between a vendor and calls in the creative's call chain.

You can create a collection that either bans or allows one or more ad servers.

> [!WARNING]
> Creating a collection of trusted ad servers will significantly limit the number of advertisers who can bid on your impressions. If you don't receive the amount of impressions you expect, check these settings to ensure you're allowing the appropriate ad servers to serve creatives on your property.

To create a collection of eligible or banned ad servers, first navigate to the **Ad Quality** page for either your publisher or your network. (See [Explore Publisher Ad Quality](explore-publisher-ad-quality.md) or [Network Ad Quality Screen](network-ad-quality-screen.md) for more on setting ad quality.) Modifying the ad server settings at the network level will apply the settings to all publishers on the network. If your network is owned and operated, you'll always want to create these settings at the network level.

By default, all ad servers are eligible to serve creatives on your property. You can change the default under **Ad Servers** by clicking the button next to **Default ad server eligibility** and changing the default to **Banned**.

> [!WARNING]
> If you change the default under **Ad Servers** to **Banned**, no creatives will serve until you've edited the Ad Servers and created a collection of eligible ad servers.

To create a collection of ad servers that are either Eligible or Banned, follow these steps:

## Step 1. Go to the Ad Servers page

From the **Network Ad Quality** page or the **Publisher Ad Quality** page, under **Ad Servers**, click **Edit** next to **Ad Servers**. This will open the **Ad Servers** page.

## Step 2. Set the default eligibility

At the top of the page are two options, **Eligible** and **Banned**. **Eligible** is selected by default. (If you changed the default to **Banned** on the **Ad Quality** screen, **Banned** will be selected here.) Making all ad servers eligible by default allows you to create of set of specific ad servers that will be banned. Click the **Banned** option if you want to ban all ad servers by default, then create a set of ad servers that are eligible.

## Step 3. Create a list of banned or trusted ad servers

On the left side of the screen is a list of ad servers with a button next to each one.

- If **Eligible** is selected as the default eligibility, each button will show the **Banned** symbol. Click the button next to each ad server that you want to ban from serving creatives to your network or publisher. This will move the ad server to the set of **Banned Ad Servers** on the right.
- If **Banned** is selected as the default eligibility, each button will show the **Eligible** symbol. Click the button next to each ad server that you want to trust to serve creatives to your network or publisher. This will move the ad server to the set of **Eligible Ad Servers** on the right.

It is possible to create two collections of ad servers, a collection of trusted ad servers and a collection of banned ad servers. However, this isn't necessary because the default will still apply to all ad servers that have not been added to a collection.

## Step 4. Save your ad server settings

Click **Save** to save your changes.
