# Impression-to-click, Click-to-conversion optimization

The optimization team is excited to announce the release of a new enhancement to our optimization logic: impression-to-click, click-to-conversion optimization, or "imp-to-click" for short. Imp-to-click only affects managed and cross-net campaigns with post-click CPA goals. This enhancement works by looking at both click-through rate and conversion rate, as opposed to just conversion rate. Using imp-to-click, we estimate conversion rates as follows:

```
predicted conversion rate = (predicted click-through rate) * (predicted click-to-conversion rate)
```

The advantage of doing this is that we can make accurate click-through rate predictions much sooner than we can accurate conversion rate predictions.

This enhancement improves the speed of learn for both new publishers and campaigns by quickly killing off campaigns with poor click-through rates that are unlikely to perform, thus allowing publishers to allocate impressions to campaigns with a higher chance of success and campaigns to focus their learning on publishers where they are more likely to be successful.

One thing to be aware of is that imp-to-click does have the potential to initially bias too much toward campaigns with unusually high click-through rates (relative to their overall conversion rate), but as more accurate click-to-conversion rate data is accumulated for these campaign, the biasing will go away.
