# Update payment rules

The **Payment Rules** screen shows you
the existing payment rules that have been established for a publisher.
These are created primarily to allow publishers to have separate and
distinct payment conditions with members. You can create payment rules,
edit existing payment rules, and view details about them.

## Getting to the payment rules screen

To reach this screen, select **Publishers** \> **Payment Rules** in
the menu bar.

## Viewing payment rules information

The information on the **Payment Rules** screen show the dollars that have been earned by different
categories (publisher, network, etc.):

- **ID**: The unique identification number
  of the payment rule.
- **Rule**: The name of the payment rule.
- **Type**: The type of payment rule. This
  can be **Base** or
  **Conditional**.
- **Priority**: The order in which rules
  are considered when determining which payment rule to apply.
  Priorities can be from **1** to **10**, with **1** being the lowest
  priority and **10** being the highest priority.
- **Revenue (USD)**: Indicates the total
  dollars earned through this payment rule.
- **Publisher Revenue (USD)**: Indicates
  the total dollars earned by the publisher through this payment rule.
- **Network RPM (USD)**: Indicates the
  dollars earned per 1,000 impressions by the network through this
  payment rule.
- **Publisher RPM (USD)**: Indicates the
  dollars earned per 1,000 impressions by the publisher through this
  payment rule.

Additionally, you can change the time frame of the information with the
date dropdown.

You can select one of the following time frames:

- **Today**
- **Yesterday**
- **Last 7 Days**
- **Lifetime**

## Filtering payment rules

You can apply filters to limit the number of payment rules visible on
this screen. To do so, select the
**Filter** button. The
**Name/ID** field appears. Enter the name
or unique identification number of the rule(s) you wish to see and
select **Apply Filter**. The list will
show only those rules that match the filter criteria.

## Creating new base and conditional payment rules

You can create new base and conditional rules on this page. Click the
**Create New** option to expose the
dropdown list, and choose **Base** or
**Conditional**. For the detailed steps
required to create a payment rule, see [Create Payment Rules](create-payment-rules.md).

## Editing a conditional payment rule

To make changes to a conditional payment rule, select the line of the
payment rule you wish to edit (this is different than checking the
checkbox). The **Payment Rules Details**
section appears at the bottom of the screen. To change any settings for
that publisher, select the **Full Edit**
button.

For details on the specific settings, see
[Create Payment Rules](create-payment-rules.md).

## Deleting conditional payment rules

To delete one or more payment rules, check the checkbox of each payment
rule you want to delete. Once at least one payment rule has been
checked, theoptions in the **More Actions** dropdown become active.
Select the **Delete** option. A
confirmation dialog appears.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot delete Base payment rules.

Once you confirm the deletion, the selected payment rules are removed
from the list.

## Duplicating conditional payment rules

To copy one or more payment rules, check the checkbox of each payment
rule you want to duplicate. Once at least one payment rule has been
checked, the options in the **More
Actions** dropdown become active. Select the
**Duplicate** option. A confirmation
dialog appears.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot duplicate Base payment rules.

Once you confirm the duplication, the rule or rules that you duplicated
appear in the list preceeded by the word
**Copy**. If desired, you can edit this
field to change the name (using up to 100 characters).
