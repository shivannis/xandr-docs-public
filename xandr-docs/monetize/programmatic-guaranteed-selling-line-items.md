# Selling Programmatic Guaranteed deals

Programmatic guaranteed (PG) selling line items provide a workflow for you to for create and sell PG deals to buyers who use Microsoft Invest and other partner DSPs.

PG deals combine the certainty of direct sales with the power of programmatic, enabling publishers to programmatically execute direct deals with buyers. With PG deals, you have the power of guaranteed selling within a bidding environment using deal IDs. Instead of using traditional insertion orders, Microsoft Advertising PG offerings unlock the world of direct buying and selling through centralized, programmatic channels. They also bring the advantage of commitments to programmatic-oriented buyers and sellers, enabling far greater predictability for your deals.

PG selling line items are used to create fixed price deals with specified impression budgets, forecasts in the ad server, reservations, and guaranteed pacing and delivery.

A PG selling line item defines a negotiated order with a buyer, including:

- **Revenue Type and Floor Pricing** - how the advertiser has agreed to pay you

  - **CPM** ("fixed price" deals) that compete in the auction at a fixed price whenever the buyer bids above that price

- **Priority** - the buyer's ranking in the auction, and also whether or not open-auction bids are allowed to compete with the deal line item in the auction

- **Budget** - the deal's impression goal target

PG selling line items offer some of the following advantages:

- ability to run and accept programmatic guarantees with programmatic buyers
- streamlined execution and reporting of guaranteed media buys
- frequency and reach management within the PG deal
- predictable revenue
