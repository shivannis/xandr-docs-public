# Microsoft Monetize - Curated deals

> [!NOTE]
> Deal curation is not available to all clients. Contact your Microsoft Advertising representative for information on how you can be enabled for deal curation.

## Microsoft Curate client overview

Microsoft Curate enables curators like retailers,
data companies, independent trading desks, and other media companies to
use their proprietary assets to enhance the value of a seller’s
inventory and create unique offerings for buyers. These proprietary
assets can include audience data, preferred inventory access, specially
negotiated rates with sellers, optimization capabilities, investment
strategy, and other features. Curated deals can be bought via
Microsoft Advertising's Invest DSP and all major DSPs.

In addition, for buyers who execute a large volume of campaigns and need
to manage their media investment, Microsoft Curate’s
deal curation technology offers a single platform to easily centralize
their business rules and targeting configurations across DSPs to
simplify campaign execution. Using Microsoft Curate,
buyers could act as curators to create deals that reflect their
decisions about segments, supply types, inventory lists, margin
percentage, optimization, and so on.

## Common questions

**What fees/charges are associated with curated transactions?**

Certain fees/charges apply to curated transactions, but only if the bid
for the curated deal wins the impression in the seller’s final auction.
These fees/charges may include a tech fee charged by
Microsoft Advertising to the third-party curator for its use of
the platform and the Microsoft Curate technology,
and a margin to be charged by the curator for their enhancement of the
inventory. If you are a seller, all bids for curated transactions will
be submitted to your final auction net of such fees/charges unless you
agree otherwise with the applicable curator, and such bids will need to
compete in your final auction in order to win the impression. Again, to
be clear, no curation-related fees/charges will apply if a bid for
inventory via curation does not win.

**Will my eligibility settings be respected for curated transactions?**

Yes. Curated transactions are not guaranteed deals and will not override
any seller account configurations, including ad quality settings or
floor price settings. A curator simply “overlays” the inventory with
their assets and, like a buyer, cannot modify any account settings. Any
bids submitted for a curated transaction will be subject to the same
eligibility settings as any other buyer.

**Can I choose which curators to work with?**

Yes. Via the Partner Center screen located in the UI, sellers can block
transactions with other members on the platform, including buyers and
curators. Generally, curators are identified with “\[CURATOR\]” at the
end of their member name. Sellers can also pull reporting on each
curator’s activity with your member through the Network Analytics report
by adding “is curated” and/or “curator member ID” as a dimension. For
more information, see [Partner Center Screen - Seller View](partner-center-screen-seller-view.md) or reach out to your account management
team.

**How do I know I’m getting a better deal with curation?**

Curation allows third parties to easily enrich your inventory with their
data, thereby bringing more demand for your inventory. With curation,
buyers can still bid on seller inventory via open exchange, but buyers
that target curated deals may also bid on seller inventory via curated
transactions. All bids submitted for curated transactions will compete
in the seller's final auction with all other deal and open exchange
bids, net of all applicable fees and charges. As with any bid, a bid for
a curated transaction needs to meet seller eligibility criteria AND be
the highest bid of that auction in order to win the impression. For more
information on revenue forecasts/expectations, please reach out to your
account management team.
