# Explore the monetization dashboard

The **Monetization Dashboard** shows you key publisher performance metrics at a glance in several sections. This page describes the
different sections of the Dashboard.

> [!NOTE]
> The data on the **Monetization Dashboard** is not updated in real time. The most recent data on the Dashboard will be from the previous day (in
> UTC). The delay is necessary because we pull some reporting data from external systems. Data is always displayed in UTC. The data does not reflect revenue associated with fixed fee direct line items, or otherwise allocated via adjustments. Use the [Network Analytics Report](network-analytics-report.md) for a complete view of your revenue.

## Get to the dashboard

Publisher-only clients: Select **Reports >  Dashboard**.

All other clients: Select **Publishers >  Dashboard**.

The default view of the screen with no filters selected is shown below. Each section of the Dashboard is described in more detail in the following sections. 

## Use Filters to understand performance

The metrics shown by default include all demand sources and all inventory. No filters are applied. If you need more detailed
information, you can change the settings to show performance metrics across different time frames, inventory, buyers, and sales channels.

For example, you might want to see how mediated buyers are performing on a particular mobile web property. You can also use filters to seek out low-performing buyers and/or slices of inventory so that you can adjust your strategy. The charts update automatically when you change the filters.

## Performance snapshot

The **Performance Snapshot** shows you how your inventory is performing compared to last week along several key metrics. These metrics consist of:

- **Revenue** - Total revenue.
- **eCPM** - Effective cost per thousand impressions.
- **RPM** - Revenue per thousand impressions.
- **Fill Rate** - Kept impressions and resold impressions divided by the total number of impressions.
- **Filled Impressions** - Kept impressions and resold impressions.
- **Impressions** - All impressions.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Why do we compare this week to last week? Having a good reference point to compare to helps you understand material changes in your business versus revenue peaks and
  > valleys that can occur such as over weekends or at the beginning of the month.

## Analytics

The **Analytics** view is a graph where you can compare two different metrics. For example, **Revenue** vs. **Total Impressions**. You can look at metrics for the last 30 days or the last week. It updates when you change your filters, allowing you to, for example, analyze data from only mediated ad networks, or view revenue vs. total impressions over
the last week coming from RTB.

> [!NOTE]
> Each metric uses a different scale, shown along the left and right axis, and color-coordinated with the graph lines.

To view detail about a particular day, move your mouse over the point to display a summary box. A summary box appears with the numeric data for that day.

## Top buyers and advertisers

The **Top Buyers & Advertisers** panel is designed to help you understand your top buyers and their spending behaviors. In addition to showing the raw stats for each buyer or
advertiser, it shows the week-over-week percentage change for the performance of each. Each has a label attached to show whether they are
buying via mediation or RTB. The list updates when you change your filters.

## Top publishers and placement groups

The **Top Publishers & Placement** Groups panel is designed to help you understand your top publishers and the performance of individual placement groups. It shows buying results, including fill rate percentage. Like the **Top Buyers & Advertisers** panel, in addition to showing the raw stats for each, it shows the week-over-week percentage change for the performance of each. The list updates when you change your filters.
