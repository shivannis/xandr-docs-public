# Microsoft Monetize - Foreign exchange margin

Microsoft Advertising charges an **FX Margin** (Foreign Exchange Margin) for clearing media cost in non-USD currencies.This charge is applied to offset the risk that Microsoft Advertising assumes
due to the natural fluctuations of currency exchange rates during the course of a month of buying/selling activity. If you have any questions
about this charge, contact your Account Manager.

## Rates

The table below lists the FX Margin Rates per currency. These rates are subject to change and are set by Microsoft Advertising based on currency volatility, transaction volume, and cost to clear.

## How is FX margin applied?

- FX margin is only charged on non-USD media costs that Microsoft Advertising clears.
  - For Buyers, this is any non-USD "Cost of Media" on the invoice.
  - For Sellers, this is any non-USD "Seller Revenue" on a payment.
- FX Margin is a percentage calculated by multiplying the FX Margin Rate % \* Media Cost.
- We will waive FX Margin when the buyer and seller billing currencies are equivalent (effective 2/1/2021).
- Margin can be charged as either a fee or deduction (both are described below in greater detail).

## Fee vs Deduction

Microsoft Advertising can charge FX Margin as either a fee or deduction (depending on what the client prefers). Generally, we apply whatever method is being used for the client's BASC/SASC charges (but that can be overridden as needed). Each charging method is described below:

| FX Margin as a Deduction | FX Margin as a Fee |
|--|--|
| - A revenue sharing percentage, calculated by multiplying the FX Margin Rate % * Media Cost<br> - **Included** in cost budget<br> - **Bid reduced**<br>Rolled into media cost during billing, will appear as "Cost of Media" on the buyer's invoice.<br> - Can be charged to both buyers and sellers depending on where the FX risk lies. |  - A revenue sharing percentage, calculated by multiplying the FX Margin Rate % * Media Cost<br> - **Not included** in cost budget<br> - **Not bid reduced**<br> - Not included in media cost during billing, therefore appears as a separate line item on an invoice as "FX Margin Fee".<br> - Can be charged to both buyers and sellers depending on where the FX risk lies. |

## Reconciliation

To reconcile the FX Margin charge that may be applied to you with your invoices, refer to the applicable section below.

## Buyers

Buyers can view either FX Margin Fees or Deductions in the Buying Billing Report in the UI. To view these values within that report, select the applicable metric (e.g., **FX Margin Fee** or **FX Margin Deduction**) prior to running the report.

## Sellers

To protect contract terms privacy, Microsoft Advertising does not expose sell-side revenue sharing in reporting.
