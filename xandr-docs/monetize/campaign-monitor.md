We built the Campaign Monitor to help campaign managers and ad operations teams view delivery and performance of line items and campaigns at-a-glance. The Campaign Monitor allows you to quickly view which line items and campaigns are on track for performance and delivery and which may need a little more attention to get back on track. The
Campaign Monitor also allows you to dig into line item and campaign setup quickly and easily. You can go directly from the Campaign Monitor to the line item or campaign in question to view and edit targeting details and campaign settings.

## At-a-glance

To open Campaign Monitor, select **Advertiser >  Campaign Monitor**. Note that this option is not available for all customers.

You can view metrics for the lifetime of a line item or for yesterday. Metrics are based on the local time for your network. Data is current to within approximately one hour.

To view the available metrics, click the **Columns** button to drop down a list of metrics you can choose to display in the Campaign Monitor grid.

  You can also choose to view these additional metrics:

- **Revenue eCPM:** How much money the network made per thousand impressions.
- **Imps Expected:** How many impressions should have served to date if impression budget were paced evenly over the lifetime of the line item or campaign.
- **Media Cost Expected:** How much money the network should have spent to date if budget were paced evenly over the lifetime of the line item or campaign.

  You can select to **Show stats** for either the **Lifetime** of the line item or campaign or from **Yesterday**. Yesterday is based on local time for your member.

## Exporting campaign monitor

You can export Campaign Monitor results to a CSV file if you want to do more in-depth analysis or you have your own tools (such as tools you've built into Microsoft Excel). Click the **Export** dropdown, give your file a name (or leave the default), and click **Export**.

## Pacing bars

The Campaign Monitor gives you a visual of line item and campaign delivery by using pacing bars. Pacing bars are displayed any place you've set a budget. The pacing bar is used to gauge how far along you are in your budget compared to where you should be. It also tells you what % you are pacing to.

The color of the pacing bar is also based on how close you are to pacing so you can quickly view a line item or campaign's health. If your pacing bar is grey it's because we
don't have flight dates for the line item or the campaign and therefore, cannot determine how far along the line item or campaign should be. **If you'd like to see the line item or campaign pacing compared to expected pacing, please read** [Getting the Most out of Campaign Monitor](campaign-monitor.md#getting-the-most-out-of-campaign-monitor), **below**.

## Personalizing your pacing bars

You can change the colors and ranges on your pacing bars. Click the pacing bar arrow to open the **Customize pacing target colors and ranges** dropdown. Moving the range sliders and select the colors you want, then click **Save Settings**.

## Filtering

Click the **+Filter** button to select which line items to display in the grid. You can filter on Advertiser, Insertion Order, Name/ID, Sales Rep, and Trafficker. The filter allows you to easily find line items that are relevant to you. Filters will not be applied until you select the type of filter (such as Advertiser) and the individual advertisers, insertion orders, etc. that you want to filter on.

You can also filter which line items display in the grid by their "last served date."

## Alerts

Alerts allow you to quickly see which line items are not serving. By default, the Campaign Monitor pulls in any line item or campaign that has served in the last 14 days, since we do not want to make assumptions about whether or not a campaign or line item is supposed to be serving or not. The monitor pulls in line items and campaigns that have not been serving for some time, so we needed to differentiate between campaigns that are eligible to serve but are not serving (Alert !), and campaigns that are not eligible to serve and are not serving (Paused). Hover over an alert icon the see the Status of that alert.

**Pauses:**

- A campaign or line item is inactive.
- One or more parent objects is inactive.
- The start date is in the future or end date is in the past.
- Lifetime or daily impression budget is met.

**Alerts:**

- Lifetime or daily budget is set to "0."
- No creatives associated with this campaign or if no creative is eligible.

## Viewing campaigns

You can view metrics for all campaigns associated with a line item by clicking on the **Campaigns+** button in the **Line Items** column. This will list the campaigns associated with that line item, along with the campaign pacing and performance information.

## Details pane

By clicking the **Details** button for any line item or campaign, the Campaign Monitor allows you to dig deeper into line item and campaign performance with graphs and setup details. You can also click through directly to the line item or campaign from the details pane, which allows you to review settings that may be hindering delivery or
performance.

## Graphs

In the details pane, you can view expected metrics compared to actual metrics based on a cumulative lifetime view and an individual day view. Click on the button in the **Metrics** section that corresponds to the metric you want to see in graph view.

## Line item or campaign settings

The details pane displays the most prominent line item or campaign settings. You can also easily click through directly to the line item or campaign in question by
clicking the **Edit settings for this line item** (or campaign) option at the bottom of the details pane.

You can also click through directly to any creatives that may be causing alerts. Click the Status button to see alert details.

## Getting the Most out of Campaign Monitor

There are a few tweaks you can make during line item and campaign set up to improve how helpful the Campaign Monitor is to you.

## Display of pacing bars

Pacing bars can only be displayed if we can decipher how long the line item or campaign will run and how much budget you have for that time (whether an impression budget, a revenue budget, or a media cost budget). Putting in definitive flight dates at the line item level or on all campaigns will allow you to view a pacing bar. Also, setting lifetime budgets, as opposed to choosing "unlimited," will also allow us to display more information in the pacing bar.
Setting these budgets at the line item level is best, but if that doesn't fit the model of your business, setting a budget on all campaigns associated with a line item allows us to add up the campaign budgets to create a line item level.

## Days into flight

You must set flight dates on the line item level or on all campaigns to be able to view days into flight information. Flight dates are also necessary to view pacing bars.
