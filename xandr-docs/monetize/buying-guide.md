## In this guide

- [Ad Buying with Microsoft Advertising](ad-buying-with-xandr.md): The combination of market positioning and single-point access to programmatic buying features through Monetize add up to unparalleled advantages for ad buying.
- [Basic Buy-side Setup Procedures](basic-buy-side-setup-procedures.md): This overview walks through the essential procedures used to set up ad purchasing in Monetize.
- [Automatic Archiving of Buy-Side Objects](automatic-archiving-of-buy-side-objects.md): To avoid confusion and clutter, some buy-side objects are automatically moved to an archived state and removed from view.
- [Working with Advertisers](working-with-advertisers.md): The advertiser object is the top level of the buy-side hierarchy (Advertiser \> Line Items \> Campaigns). Before you can set up line items to define your financial agreement and then start running campaigns and serving creatives on behalf of an advertiser, you must set up the advertiser itself.
- [Working with Insertion Orders](working-with-insertion-orders.md):  Insertion orders offer an additional level of flexibility, letting you bucket line items and campaigns under an advertiser (**Advertiser** \>  **Insertion Order**  \> **Line Items**).
- [Working with Line Items](working-with-line-items.md): A line item defines your financial agreement with an advertiser, including how much the advertiser has allocated for you to spend (budget), the basis on which the advertiser has agreed to pay you (revenue type), and performance requirements the advertiser expects you to meet (advertiser goals).
- [Working with Programmable Splits](working-with-programmable-splits.md): Programmable splits let you automate ad targeting using rulesets to ensure your ads are delivered and your budget is allocated to very specific segments.
- [Working with Campaigns](working-with-campaigns.md): If you use standard line items, you can set up campaigns to buy media based on your agreement. Setting up a campaign involves defining how much you are willing to spend (media budget), whether you want to buy both direct, third-party, or both types of inventory, how you want to bid (buying strategies), and how you want to target inventory and users. ([Augmented Line Items (ALI)](augmented-line-items-ali.md) include this information, so separate campaigns aren't needed.)
- [Buy-Side Targeting](buy-side-targeting.md): You can apply a wide range of targeting strategies to line items or campaigns. These strategies are essential for ensuring a return on your ad spending by making sure you reach relevant audiences.
- [Budgeting and Pacing](budgeting-and-pacing.md): Budgeting allows you to determine how much money you will earn or spend, while Pacing allows you to control the frequency with which the system attempts to win impressions in order to spend a budget as evenly as possible across a defined time period.
- [Working with Creatives](working-with-creatives.md): The Microsoft Advertising platform enables you to traffic a wide range of creative types in your campaigns, from banners to pops to increasingly pervasive rich media types like interstitials, expandables, and videos. By hosting your creatives with us, you can take full advantage of the platform's full-service ad server capabilities built specifically for the real-time advertising business. Microsoft Advertising makes it easy for you to traffic creatives that are served by third-party ad servers as well.
- [Working with Segments](working-with-segments.md): Segment pixels use information about a user, such as webpages they visit, actions they take, or qualities such as gender, location, and wealth, to assign that user to a group called a segment for future targeting.
- [Working with Conversion Pixels](working-with-conversion-pixels.md): Conversion pixels are used to track user actions in response to advertisers' creatives, such as registering at a site or making a purchase. When a conversion pixel fires, Microsoft Advertising determines if the conversion (the registration, the purchase, etc.) can be "attributed", or tied to the user clicking on or viewing one of the advertiser's creatives previously.
- [Working with Impression and Click Trackers](working-with-impression-and-click-trackers.md): Impression and click trackers are used to track impressions and clicks associated with creatives that are hosted by off-platform (non-Microsoft Advertising) ad servers. This is done by attaching the tracker as a "piggyback pixel" on the externally hosted creative. This lets you report on impressions and clicks on these creatives as if they were hosted by Microsoft Advertising.
- [Create a User](create-a-user.md): You can create advertiser users for advertisers that want to run reports for themselves. An advertiser user does not see data about any other advertisers and does not have editing capabilities.
- [APAC Supply Information - Platform Inventory by Seller](apac-supply-information-platform-inventory-by-seller.md)
- [Working with Trader Home](working-with-trader-home.md)
- [Welcome to Mobile](welcome-to-mobile.md): Advertising on mobile devices is mostly similar to traditional display advertising (and where it differs, we'll explain those differences). This section is designed to provide you with a solid understanding of how advertising works on mobile devices.
- [Introduction to Viewability](introduction-to-viewability.md): Understand how Microsoft Advertising measures ad views, and optimize the chances of your audience viewing your creatives.
- [Buying Video Inventory](buying-video-inventory.md): This guide provides advanced video reference information as well as information about buying in-stream, out-stream, and ConnectedTV inventory.
- [Buying Audio Inventory](buying-audio-inventory.md): This guide provides information about buying audio inventory.
- [Buying Microsoft Inventory](buying-microsoft-inventory.md): This guide provides information about buying inventory on multiple Microsoft properties, including MSN, Outlook, and Windows.
- [Buying Native Inventory](buying-native-inventory.md): Websites that sell native inventory accept ad content but enforce their own display properties to integrate. This guide describes how to buy native inventory on properties that allow it.
- [Native Inventory Seller Specifications](native-inventory-seller-specifications.md): Buying native inventory requires understanding detailed seller requirements.
- [Campaign Monitor](campaign-monitor.md): The Campaign Monitor allows you to quickly view which line items and campaigns are on track for performance and delivery and which may need a little more attention to get back on track.
- [Guaranteed Delivery](guaranteed-delivery.md): For direct-sold business, where sales has secured an insertion order from a buyer with a committed impression volume, the most important performance indicator is that the line item delivers its budget in full and evenly across its flight dates.
- [Data Marketplace Overview](data-marketplace-overview.md): Microsoft Advertising supports automatic clearing of third-party segment data you can purchase and use to target audience segments.
