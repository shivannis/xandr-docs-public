# Microsoft Monetize -  Share your packages with buyers

As a seller, you can proactively commercialize your packages by sending links to both Microsoft Advertising and external buyers. This page walks you through the process.

## Share packages with any buyer

To generate a public link that you can send to any buyer, on Microsoft Monetize or off:

1. Click the **Open Public Package** button.
1. Copy the URL in the screen that opens. This is the screen the buyer will see.
1. Email it to any buyers who would be interested in your packages.

## Share packages with a specific buyer

If you have customized packages for a specific buyer, you can grab a unique link to send just to that buyer:

1. Click the **Preview Packages** button.
1. On the **Packages Preview** screen, select **Select a specific buyer**, select the buyer, and click **OK**.
1. Once you're viewing your packages from the buyer's perspective,  click the **Open \< Buyer's\> Catolog** button.
1. Copy the URL in the screen that opens.
1. Email it to the specific buyer.
