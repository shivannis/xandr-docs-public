# Direct inventory targeting

> [!NOTE]
> This form of targeting is only available to Standard Line Items. For an overview of which targeting options are available to Standard versus Augmented Line items, see [Buy-Side Targeting](buy-side-targeting.md).

If your campaign is set to buy direct inventory, your campaign will
target all of your direct inventory by default. However, you can narrow
your targeting to include or exclude specific managed publishers, sites,
or placements.

1. In the **Targeting** section, click
    **Edit** next to **Inventory**.
1. On the **Direct Inventory** tab,
    include or exclude direct inventory at the appropriate level:
    - The **Publishers** lists shows all of your managed publishers. You
      can either include or exclude publishers or drill into a publisher
      to view its sites.
    - The **Placement Groups** lists shows all of the sites under your
      managed publishers. You can either include or exclude sites or
      drill into a site to view its placements. Note that when you
      exclude a publisher, its sites are not available for further
      inclusion or exclusion.
    - The **Placements** list shows all placements under your managed
      publishers and sites. You can either include or exclude
      placements. Note that when you exclude a publisher or site, its
      placements are not available for further inclusion or exclusion.
    - **Text Mode** lets you target managed objects by ID. To do so,
      switch into **text** mode, select the type of ID, enter the IDs
      separated by commas, space, or lines, and then select
      **Include** or
      **Exclude**.
1. Click **Add**.
