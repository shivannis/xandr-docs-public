- Creative Format: **Third-party tag**

  In the Tag field, paste in the tag you received from Seedtag when you
  sent your creative. You will need to edit the tag. Your tag will
  contain a section like this:

  ```
  /** PUT THE FINAL URL BETWEEN QUOTES **/ var targetUrl = "https://LandingPageUrl.com"; /** /PUT THE FINAL URL BETWEEN QUOTES **/ 
  ```

  Replace the `targetURL` value with your URL:

  ```
  /** PUT THE FINAL URL BETWEEN QUOTES **/ var targetUrl = "https://YourCampignUrl.com"; /** /PUT THE FINAL URL BETWEEN QUOTES **/ 
  ```

  If you want to use an external click command, put that command in place of your URL.
