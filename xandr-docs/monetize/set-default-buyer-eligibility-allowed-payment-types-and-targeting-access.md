# Microsoft Monetize - Set default buyer settings

On the **Partner Center** screen, the **Default Settings** option allows you to establish default buyer eligibility, allowed payment types, and targeting access for all buyers. It is possible to override these settings for individual buyers.

<!--For details, see [Default Buyer Eligibility, Payment Types, Targeting Access](edit-buyer-eligibility-allowed-payment-types-and-targeting-access.md).-->

## Getting there

**Publisher clients:** select **Marketplace** > **Partner Center**.

**All other clients:** select **Partners** > **Partner Center**.

## Step 1. Get started

From the **Partner Center**, click the **Default Settings** button to display the **Default Settings** dialog.

## Step 2. Set default settings

### Set default buyer eligibility

This setting is similar to banning or trusting members using ad quality settings. If you ban a buyer in either your ad quality settings or in Partner Center, that member will be banned. A member does not need to be banned in both places.

For more information on the different options described in this section, see the **Setting default buyer eligibility** section within [Setting Buyer Defaults](partner-center-screen-seller-view.md).

### Set default allowed payment types

These are the type(s) of payment you accept from partners whose eligibility is set to eligible. CPM is selected by default for all eligible buyers and cannot be unchecked since it is the standard payment type for third-party inventory.

You can also opt into allowing members to pay for inventory on a CPC or CPA basis. If you allow CPC and CPA payment, you must also set up your publishers to accept CPC and CPA payment types.

For more information, see [CPC and CPA Payment Types](cpc-and-cpa-payment-types.md).

### Set default targeting access

This indicates the information each member receives when targeting your inventory. Members cannot report on this information; it is only used for targeting. The more information you give buyers, the more easily they can target your inventory.

For more information on the different targeting access options, see the **Setting default targeting access** section within [Setting Buyer Defaults](partner-center-screen-seller-view.md).

For **Categories (Custom)** there is the additional option to expose specific categories. To select specific custom categories, choose **Select** beneath the **Category (Custom)** option to display the list of categories. Click on a category in the **Available Items** area to add it to the **Selected Items** area. To remove a category from the **Selected Items** area, click the **X** next to the category name. When you have finished selecting custom categories, click **Add** to save your changes.

## Step 3. Save your settings

Click the **Save** button to record updates to your settings.
