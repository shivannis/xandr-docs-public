# Update a placement

There are many actions you can perform on placements. This page explains
how to edit, delete, duplicate, and move placements.

## Edit a placement

You can edit a placement by clicking the placement row to select and
highlight it, then clicking either the **Full
Edit** or **Edit Inline** button in
the **Placement Details** pane that
appears. See [Create a Placement](create-a-placement.md) for descriptions of the fields you can edit.

## Delete a placement

You can delete placements from the Microsoft Advertising system
in just two steps.

> [!WARNING]
> Before you proceed, please note that deleting placements is permanent and cannot be reversed.

## Step 1. Get started with placements

**Publisher-only clients:** Select
**Placements** from the
**Inventory** menu in the main
navigation menu, then select the publisher you want to work with from
the Select a Publisher dialog. This opens the
**Placement Manager**, which shows
both the **Placement Group List** and the
**Placement List** under each placement
group for the publisher.

**All other clients:** Go to **Publishers** \> **Placement Manager**
and select the publisher you want to work with. This will open the
**Placement List** for that publisher.
Click the box(es) next to the placement or placements you want to
delete.

## Step 2. Confirm deletion

Once you have selected the placement or placements to delete, select
**More Actions** \> **Delete**. This
will open the **Confirm delete**
dialog. Verify that you want to delete the placement by clicking
**Confirm**.

> [!NOTE]
> If a managed campaign is directly targeting the placement, you will see the warning "Cannot delete placement that is targeted by campaigns. Contact Microsoft Advertising support." In order to delete this placement, you will need to first remove the placement from the campaign targeting. Once this is done, you should be able to delete the placement.

## Move a placement to a different placement group

A placement is an open slot on a publisher website where an advertiser
creative with matching specifications can serve. Placement groups
provide a way for you to organize and manage placements, apply default
inventory categorization, and self-auditing criteria to child
placements. This page explains how to move a placement to a new
placement group.

## Step 1. Get started with moving placements

**Publisher-only clients:** Select **Inventory** \> **Placements**, then select the publisher you want to work with from the **Select a Publisher** dialog. This opens the **Placement Manager**, which shows both the **Placement Group List** and the **Placement List** under each placement group for the publisher.

**All other clients:** Go to **Publishers** \> **Placement Manager**
and select the publisher you want to work with. This will open the
**Placement List** for that publisher.
Click the box(es) next to the placement or placements you want to move.

## Step 2. Move the desired placements to a different placement group

Check the checkbox for the placement under which you want to move to
another new placement group, then click
**More Actions** \> **Move**. This will
open the **Select a destination placement
group** dialog. Click **Select** to
complete the action. If you want to move more than one placement to the
same group, you can move them all at once by checking multiple boxes.

## Step 3. Review the placement list

In the **Placement Group List**, click the
placement group under which you moved the placement. You should see the
placements you moved show up in the
**Placement List** for that placement
group.

## Duplicate a placement

When you want to create a number of similar placements, you can save
time by duplicating placements and editing the specific features you
want to modify.

## Step 1. Get started with duplicating placements

**Publisher-only clients:** Select **Inventory** \> **Placements**, then select the
publisher you want to work with from the
**Select a Publisher** dialog. This
opens the **Placement Manager**, which
shows both the **Placement Group
List** and the **Placement List**
under each placement group for the publisher.

**All other clients:** Go to
**Publishers** \> **Placement Manager**
and select the publisher you want to work with. This will open the
**Placement List** for that publisher.
Click the box(es) next to the placement or placements you want to
duplicate.

## Step 2. Confirm duplicate

Once you have selected the placement or placements to duplicate, go to
the **More Actions** dropdown and select
**Duplicate**.This will open the
**Confirm duplicate** dialog. Type the
name of your new placement into the text box and click
the **Confirm** button.

## Step 3. Make changes to the new placement

Once you have renamed your placement and confirmed the duplication, your
duplicate placement will show up in the Placement List. You can then
edit the placement or change its default creatives as you would for any
other.

## Set a reserve price

You can set a reserve price, which is the minimum net amount the
placement will accept for placing a creative, for the placement from the
**Placement Manager** screen in the
**Default Creatives** pane. Under
**Reserve Price Settings**, click
**Edit**, then complete the selections in
the **Reserve Price Settings** dialog that
appears as below:

- **Reserved price based on**: Select
  the criteria of calculating the reserved price from total
  **Network revenue** or total
  **Publisher revenue**.
- **Reserved price applies to**:
  Select whether reserved price is applied to :
  - **All demands**: The rule will
    apply to bids from your managed advertisers as well as third-party
    bids.
  - **Third-party and non-preferred direct
    demand**: The rule will apply to third-party bids as well as
    bids from your managed advertisers that are not considered a
    preferred bid.
  - **Third-party demand only**: The
    rule will apply to third-party bids, and not to bids from your
    managed advertisers.

  Please note that if you select **All
  demands**, the reserved price will not apply to learn bids from
  direct campaigns when your inventory prefers learn bids.
