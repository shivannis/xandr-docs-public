# Microsoft Monetize - Publisher analytics

The Publisher Analytics Report allows you to view sell-side performance data for a specific publisher. The data available via this report is even more granular than what you can get from the [Network Analytics Report](network-analytics-report.md).

## Time frame

All dates and times are given in UTC.

### Time ranges

Time ranges define the time period of the data extracted for the report. The following is a complete list of time ranges available for reports.

However, all time ranges are not available for every report.

### Intervals

Intervals determine how your data is grouped together into rows in the report response. The following is a complete list of intervals available for reports. However, all intervals are not available for every report.

- Hourly: Data is grouped into rows by the hour.
- Daily: Data is grouped into rows by the day.
- Monthly: Data is grouped into rows by the month.
- Cumulative: Data is grouped together in one figure, covering the entire selected time range.

## Data retention period

Most data in this report is maintained permanently (exceptions noted below). After:

- 100 days, you are no longer able to report on hourly data. However, daily, monthly and cumulative intervals are still available.
- 14 months, you are no longer able to report on individual:
  - Creatives
  - Placements
  - Brands

In some cases Analytics reports can show delivery that does not match statistics shown elsewhere in Microsoft Monetize for a given advertiser or publisher. This is due to the way that Analytics reporting data older than 100 days and 14 months is aggregated. The data from Billing reports are kept in non-aggregated form indefinitely.

## Real time data

Real Time Data is a new feature being offered within this report (not all users have access yet). Traditionally, reports have had a 2 hour built-in delay to allow for a fuller reconciliation with conversions, impressions and other metrics associated with transactions. However, in some cases, it is important to have up-to-the-minute information even if it has not been fully reconciled yet. Dimensions which support the real-time option are marked with the clock icon.

:::image type="content" source="media/real-time-data-reporting.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows when Real-time data and Finalized data are available in relation to the time of event.":::

- To use this new feature, set the **Real Time Data** field to **Included**. This will cause the data in your report to contain both real-time and the more fully reconciled batch file data. If you want the report to break out the real-time data from batch file data, select the **Real-Time status** checkbox.
- Do not use information in the real-time data portion of your report to bill your clients as that data may change slightly once fully reconciled within 2 to 4 hours. For more information about how quickly reporting data is processed, see [Availability of Reporting Data](availability-of-reporting-data.md).

## To run your report

Follow these steps to run your report.

1. Select **Reporting** from the appropriate top menu depending on how your account has been configured.

    Or, from the **Publishers** top menu, click on **Prebid Server Premium** > **Analytics** > **Prebid Server Analytics**

1. Select the relevant report from the list. The **Report** screen shows the available filters, dimensions, and delivery options for the report. The selections you make here will determine what report data is delivered to you, and how.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > For an explanation of how grouping and filtering work, see [Dimensions, Metrics, Filtering, and Grouping](dimensions-metrics-filtering-and-grouping.md).

1. Select the relevant filters to limit the data displayed to just the information you want. For example, rather than running a report that shows impressions for all inventory sources, you may want to list results for just a select few. When you select a filter by clicking **Edit**, a selection panel appears. Select items in the **Available** list (left), then click **Add** to include them in the **Chosen** list (right).

1. Group by Dimension. Grouping allows you to display rows of data in the order you prefer.

    > [!WARNING]
    > The more dimensions you group by, the larger the data set that is returned. Larger data sets can take substantially longer to process. Be sure to group using only the dimensions you need.

1. Choose a delivery option. Once you've selected your filters and grouped by your chosen dimensions, you need to choose a delivery method. Available delivery methods include:

    - **Run now, show results in screen**: For smaller amounts of data, you may want to view the report as soon as possible in your browser. You can download the report in XLSX, CSV, Excel/TSV, and JSON format. However, there is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when downloading as XLSX and Excel file.

    - **Run in background, notify me when results are ready to view**: A popup notification will let you know when the report is ready to view or download.

      > [!TIP]
      > The maximum size of the report that can be downloaded from the UI is 100 MB. Also, there is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when downloading as XLSX and Excel file. If the size of the report is more than that, you can try to download it using the [API](../digital-platform-api/report-service.md) for that reporting service. The limit here is 10 million rows.

    - **Export, send results via email**: Run the report in the background and email the results to one or more email addresses.
    - **Save as report template**: Save your selected report settings so that you can run this report again in the future. You can name this template using the text entry field under **Name this report** (its checkbox is auto-selected when you choose this option). A saved report can be rerun from the **Your Reports** screen.
    - **Add to scheduled reports**: Run this report automatically at specified times and have it sent to one or more email addresses.
    - **Name this report**: Give this report with its current settings a name for future reference.
