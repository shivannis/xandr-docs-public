# Microsoft Monetize - Onboarding your audience data

There are three ways to onboard your audience data:

- [Client-Side Segmentation](client-side-segmentation.md): Allows you to build audience segments by placing client-side segment pixels on websites or creatives for simple audience targeting strategies.
- [Batch Server-Side Segmentation](../digital-platform-api/batch-server-side-segmentation.md): Allows you to batch your users together and add them to segments in bulk, via the API.
- [Streaming Server-Side Segmentation](../data-providers/streaming-server-side-segmentation.md): This method associates individual users to segments in close to real-time, via the API.

  > [!NOTE]
  > At the moment, this feature is only available to a small group of Alpha testers. It will be released more widely over the course of the next several months.
