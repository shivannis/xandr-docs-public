# Notify request

Bidders receive notifications regarding auction results, bid response time, and any errors generated by a particular bidder's bid response
(i.e. 'JSON parsing error'). These notifications will be sent via a server side call to a bidder-specified `notify_URI` when the auction has completed and the impression is served. You can manage the amount of information you receive in your notifications using the
`notify_full_auction` field in the [Bidder Service](bidder-service.md). Notifications include details about each submitted bid.

> [!NOTE]
> In certain auction types, a lost or pending notification may be generated prior to the win notification. Win notifications are always authoritative and override any other notifications previously received for that auction.

## Internal auction

For all auctions we conduct, bidders will receive notifications when an auction is won and when an error occurs. Bidders can also opt into
receiving notifications when an auction is lost by [submitting a support request](https://help.xandr.com/s/login/).

## External auction

For all auctions conducted by a third-party, bidders will receive a pending notification when their bid is passed along to the third-party, and a notification when an auction is won.

| `fail` | some | boolean | Returns true when the bid response could not be processed (e.g. invalid JSON passed in the bid response). |
| `error` | some | string | When fail is true, this field displays the corresponding error message. See [Error List](#error-list) below. |
| `error_id` | some | int | More details on the number provided can be found [here](#error-list). |
| `response_time_ms` | some | int | When provided, this is the number of milliseconds for the the `bid_response` to return. This parameter will be excluded if no response is returned. |

## Tags

| `auction_id_64` | all | int | The ID of the auction. This is useful for reconciliation and discrepancies, so we recommend that you add to your logs. |

| `price_paid` | type = won | double | The actual price paid (CPM) by the winner. This is only available if you won the impression. |
| `price_sold_for` | type = sold | double | The revenue received by the owner of the impression when sold. For sellers only. |
| `custom_notify_data` | some | string | If you won the impression for this tag, the custom notify data that you submitted for the winning bid will pass through at the tag level in the notification. |
| `payment_rule_id` | some | int | The ID of the payment rule the tag has assigned to it. |

## Responses

| Field | Scope | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|

| `price_bid` | some | double | The price bid in the bid response. |
| `error_id` | some | int | When `result` is `error`, this field displays the error code. For more information, see [Notify Request Error Codes](#error-list). |

> [!NOTE]
> The responses array will not be present when `post-pending` is `true`.

## Lost notifies

We can send you notify requests when you send a nonzero bid response for an auction, and don't win the auction. This can occur either because you were outbid, or because your bid was rejected. Bids can be rejected for either technical reasons such as a badly formed JSON message or for business-level reasons such as using a creative that is blocked by the seller, or sending a bid price which is below the floor for a deal. If you are having trouble getting delivery on a given creative, lost notify messages are a great way to see why your creative is not winning more impressions. To turn on lost notify messages, please submit a [support request](https://help.xandr.com/s/login/) and a representative can enable this for your bidder.

## Error list

For a list of all possible errors that could be sent in a Notify Request, see [Bid Error Codes](bid-error-codes.md).

## Notify full auction

If the [Bidder Service](bidder-service.md) parameter `notify_full_auction` is set to `true`, `full_tag_info`, and `bid_info` will be included in the response. The parameter `full_tag_info` contains all information described in the **Tags** section of the [Bid Request](outgoing-bid-request-to-bidders.md) page, except the *`exclusive_default`* field, while `bid_info` contains all information in the **Bid_info** and **Segments** sections of the [Bid Request](outgoing-bid-request-to-bidders.md) page.

> [!NOTE]
> For post-pending notifies (`post-pending` is set to `true`), `full_tag_info` is not available because the bid acceptance callback has not yet been received.

## Examples

### Single tag request - Auction won

> [!NOTE]
> This is only available when using the platform bid protocol. OpenRTB wins will be sent using the NURL field in the bid response.
