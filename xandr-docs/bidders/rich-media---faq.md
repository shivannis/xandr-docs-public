## Expandables

### How do I know if an impression supports an expandable creative?

There will be two fields in the bid request to indicate the availability of expandables on an impression.

| Field | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `allowed_types` | Array of media type ids | This field is optional. If it appears, creatives of the specified media types may serve on this impression. |
| `allowed_subtypes` | Array of media subtype ids | This field is optional. If it appears, creatives of the specified media subtypes may serve on this impression. |
