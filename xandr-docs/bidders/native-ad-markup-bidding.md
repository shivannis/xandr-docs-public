# Native ad markup bidding

Native Ad Markup Bidding enables your bidder to submit native ad markup via `adm` in the OpenRTB bid response. Instead of registering every native creative asset you have with Xandr, you are required to register only a single creative for each ad campaign or brand you represent; all native creative assets for that brand can be passed dynamically via ad markup in the bid response. This page explains how to use this feature.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature does not currently support bidding with native video ad markup. Only non-video native ad markup is accepted.

## Getting started

Your bidder must be enabled to use this feature. If you are not sure whether your bidder is enabled, then check with your Xandr account representative.

Once enabled, there are two steps required to buy Native inventory via Ad Markup Bidding:

1. Register your creative. For each brand that you represent, you must register a single creative that represents that brand. Your creative must pass platform audit. All native creative assets associated with this brand within your bidder will serve through this creative. For details, see [Register native creatives](#register-native-creatives) below.
1. Bid with your creative assets on native inventory. For details, see [Bid with native ad markup](#bid-with-native-ad-markup) below.

## Register native creatives

For each brand that you represent, you must register a single creative that represents that brand. This is done using the [Creative Service](creative-service.md). When registering a Native Creative, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:

- The creative must represent one of the actual native ads that you will dynamically pass on the bid response for this brand. The specific ad you choose to register does not matter, but the creative must contain at least one image asset and one data asset consistent with an ad you would actually serve on native inventory.
- When registering a creative, only [Xandr Macros](xandr-macros.md) are supported. OpenRTB macros (such as `${AUCTION_PRICE}`) will not be expanded.
- The creative must be submitted for platform audit.
- You do not need to specify the `brand_id` field; this will be set by Xandr during audit.
- Be sure to include impression and click trackers when registering your creative. The ad markup submitted in the bid response should use the same set of vendors (or fewer) that were registered with this creative.
- Be sure to use native creative template 39461.

The following section provides an example of defining and registering a Native Creative.

## Creative example

This example uses four data assets and two image assets, but you can choose to use a different combination depending on the assets you want to register. (Remember, you must have at least one asset of each type.) For more details on native creative assets, see the [Creative Service](creative-service.md).

## Bid with native ad markup

> [!NOTE]
> This feature does not currently support bidding with native video ad markup. Only non-video native ad markup is accepted.

Once you have registered a Native Creative and it has passed platform audit, you can begin bidding with that creative using the [OpenRTB protocol](bidding-protocol.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Xandr supports v1.1 of the [OpenRTB Dynamic Native Ads API](https://iabtechlab.com/specifications-guidelines/openrtb-native/).

Some considerations:

- Either the `crid` or `adid` field must be included in the bid response to identify the creative that was registered. The `crid` value must match the creative's `code;` `adid` must match the creative's `id`.
- Native creative assets must be passed via the `seatbid.bid.adm.native` object. Be sure to include image assets, data assets, impression trackers, and click trackers. These assets will serve instead of the creative asset you initially registered.
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > The creative assets you bid with must belong to the same brand as the creative asset you initially registered. Xandr periodically scans and reviews ad markup creative content to ensure this content is consistent with the registered creative. If there is a discrepancy, your creative can be rejected by platform audit. Frequent creative audit rejections due to rotating brands can result in revoked access to the Ad Markup Bidding with Native feature.

- If you do not pass native creative assets in your bid response, or the assets are malformed, the registered creative content will serve by default.

## Bid response supported fields

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The following fields are ignored in the bid response: `adomain` and `ver`.
> - Brand is set during platform audit of the registered creative, so `adomain` is not needed.

## FAQs

### Why do I have to register a creative for each brand I represent?

Xandr policy prohibits brand rotation on creatives. By registering a creative for each brand you work with, your creative will be able to pass Xandr's audit. This will maximize the native inventory on which it can serve. Xandr ensures that each creative complies with
our audit policies by performing an initial audit and then periodically scanning the creative content that your bidder dynamically passes in its bid responses. If the dynamic content served by your bidder differs substantially from the registered creative (i.e. images and text for a different brand) it will be reaudited and may be rejected.

### Will I be charged creative audit fees for periodically reaudited creative ad markup?

No. Creative audit fees will apply only during your creative's initial audit.

### What happens if my Native Creative passes initial audit but fails a subsequent reaudit?

Your creative will not be permitted to serve. The audit failure may be due to rotating brands. If you believe your creative has been failed incorrectly or have other questions contact customer support and select the Category "Creative Audit".

> [!NOTE]
> The frequent creative audit rejections due to rotating brands may result in revoked access to the Ad Markup Bidding with Native feature.

### Where do I go for more help?

If you have additional questions, contact your account representative or [customer support](https://help.xandr.com/s/login/).
