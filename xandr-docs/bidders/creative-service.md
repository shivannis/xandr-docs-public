# Bidders - Creative service

Xandr works with members who care deeply about brand and reputation. For this reason, we are careful to ensure that the advertisements (creatives) that pass through our system are acceptable to all parties. For quality assurance, all creatives that serve on third-party inventory must be pre-registered using the Creative Service.

- Creatives are identified by their media_url (either a third-party adserver URL or a Content Delivery Network URL for a flash/GIF file).
- We will check media_urls on a regular basis. If a file disappears, the creative will be treated as unaudited.
- An audit notify request will be sent to the audit_notify_uri handler for each creative whose audit status has changed.
- Uploading malware or deceptive creatives or purposely mislabeling creatives is absolutely prohibited.
- It is highly recommended to configure your member (see the [Member Service](member-service.md)) to receive emails
  when:
  - The creative is audited (by configuring the audit_notify_email field in the [Member Service](member-service.md).)
  - The creative has been scanned by [Sherlock](sherlock-creative-quality-control.md) (by configuring the sherlock_notify_email in the [Member Service](member-service.md).)

> [!NOTE]
> Expired Creative Policy
>
> When a creative (1) has not run and (2) has not been modified for 15 consecutive days, then it will be automatically marked expired ("is_expired": true) and will not serve on any inventory. Creatives will be automatically reactivated if your bidder resumes bidding with the creative.

**Permissions:**

- Only admin can change `audit_status` field.
- Creatives that are modified after they've been audited will return to an `pending` audit status.

## Pixels

You use this array to add up to five Xandr-approved and custom pixels to a creative.

**Xandr-approved pixels** are from trusted, commonly-used providers. Most of them do not cause the creative to be resubmitted for audit. To add a Xandr-approved
pixel to a creative, you need to pass only the pixel_template_id and the number of params that the pixel requires. See the "Adding a Xandr-approved pixel to a creative" example below for further guidance. Note that you can use the [Pixel Template Service](pixel-template-service.md) to get information about these pixels, including whether or not they trigger re-audit.

Custom pixels are defined by you and do cause the creative to be resubmitted for audit. To add a custom pixel, you need to pass only the format and, depending on the format, the content or url. See the [Adding a custom pixel to a creative](#adding-a-custom-pixel-to-a-creative) example below for further guidance.

| `id` | int | **Read-only**. The ID of the pixel. |
| `param_1` | string | For Xandr-approved pixel: The value for the first parameter in the pixel content or URL. To find out how many parameters are required for a Xandr-approved pixel, use the [Pixel Template Service](pixel-template-service    .md). |
| `param_2` | string | For Xandr-approved pixel: The value for the second parameter in the pixel content or URL. |
| `param_3` | string | For Xandr-approved pixel: The value for the third parameter in the pixel content or URL. |

## Changes that cause Re-Audit

Once a creative has passed Xandr audit (audit_status is "audited"), changing any of the following fields causes the creative to be resubmitted for audit (allow_audit is set to "pending"):

- width
- height
- content
- media_url
- click_url
- template
- custom_macros
- media_subtypes
- language
- categories
- technical_attributes
- brand_id
- pixel_url
- pixels (if adding or removing a custom pixel or a
  Xandr-approved pixel)
- text_title (if text creative)
- text_description (if text creative)
- text_display_url (if text creative)
- pop_window_maximize (if pop creative)
- pop_is_tag_initiated (if pop creative and changing from false to true)
- video_attribute
- media_assets

Also, if the audit_status is "no_audit", changing allow_audit from "false" to "true" causes the creative to be resubmitted for Xandr audit.

**Modifying a creative**

If you then decide to add a campaign name "Triple Play - October 2008" to the creative for reporting purposes:

``` 
$ cat creative_mod
{"creative" : {
        "campaign":"Triple Play - October 2008"
        }
}
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X PUT --data-binary @creative_mod 'https://api.adnxs.com/creative/5/6'
{
   "response":{
        "status":"OK",
        "id":6
}}
```

And then to view the change:

            }
        ],
        "status": "OK"
    }
}
```

**Submit a creative for audit**

If you would like to request an audit for a creative it must be active and have the `allow_audit` field set to true:

``` 
$ cat creative_mod
{"creative" : {
        "audit_status": "pending",
                "allow_audit" : true
        }
}
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X PUT --data-binary @creative_mod 'https://api.adnxs.com/creative/5/6'
{
   "response":{
        "status":"OK",
        "id":6
}}
```

**Unexpire a creative and resubmit for audit**

If a creative has expired, you can update it with these settings to set the status to "pending" and resubmit the creative for audit. Note that as of November 2017, creatives that have been expired for over one year will be permanently deleted. See "Expired Creative Policy" at the top of this page for more information.

``` 
$ cat unexpire_creative
{
    "creative": {
    "audit_status": "pending",
    "allow_audit": true,
    "status": {
        "user_ready": true
        }
    }
}
```

**Submit a mobile creative for audit**

This example uses the new `mobile` object:

``` 
$ cat mobile_creative
{
    "creative" : {
        "audit_status": "pending",
        "allow_audit" : true,
        "mobile" : {
                 "alternative_landing_page_url" : "https://..."
        }
    }
}
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X PUT --data-binary @creative_mod 'https://api.adnxs.com/creative/5/6'
{
   "response":{
        "status":"OK",
        "id":6
   }
}
```

**Submit a creative for priority audit**

If you would like to submit for a priority audit. Set "sla" to 2 (a value of 1 is not currently used). You will be charged a priority audit fee per your contract.

``` 
$ cat creative_mod
{"creative" : {
        "audit_status": "pending",
        "sla": 2
        }
}
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X PUT --data-binary @creative_mod 'https://api.adnxs.com/creative/5/6'
{
   "response":{
        "status":"OK",
        "id":6
}}
```

**View the estimated audit time for your creative ('sla_eta')**

``` 
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.adnxs.com/creative/5/6'
{
    "response": {
        "creatives": [
            {

            }
        ],
        "status": "OK"
    }
}
```

**Adding an iframe-html creative**

The creative service allows for a number of different types of creatives to be created. For example, to create a creative using the format "iframe-html", you would upload the raw html that will be embedded in an iframe in the page serving the ad.

``` 
$ cat iframe-html-creative
{
   "creative" : {
        "content":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" language=\"javascript\">
                   var sample_var = 350;
                   </script>
                   <script type=\"text/javascript\" language=\"javascript\" src=\"https://sample_source.com/sample_id?ord=${CACHEBUSTER}\"</script>",
        "width":"300",
        "height":"250",
        "format":"iframe-html",
        "brand_id" : 43
        }
}
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies --data-binary @iframe-html-creative 'https://api.adnxs.com/creative/5'
{
   "response":{
        "status":"OK",
        "id":7
}}
```

**Adding a Xandr-approved pixel to a creative**

This example walks you through the process of adding the Xandr-approved Evidon AdChoices Icon pixel to a creative.

First, you need to find out the pixel_template_id and the number of parameters you must define for the pixel. You use the [Pixel Template Service](pixel-template-service.md) to get this information.

``` 
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.adnxs.com/pixel-template'
{
    "response": {
        "status": "OK",
        "count": 3,
        "start_element": 0,
        "num_elements": 100,
        "pixel-templates": [
            {
                "id": 1,
                "name": "Evidon AdChoices Icon",
                "format": "raw-js",
                "content": "(function() {document.write('<sc'+'ript type=\"text/javascript\"' + ((\"https:\"
                 == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://c.betrad.com\" : \"https://c.betrad.com\") +
                 '/surly.js?;ad_wxh=${CREATIVE_SIZE};coid=${P1};nid=${P2};${P3}\"></scr'+'ipt>');}());",
                "num_required_params": 2,
                "require_reaudit": false
            },
            {
                "id": 2,
                "name": "Brilig Impression Tracker",
                "format": "url-image",
                "num_required_params": 1,
                "require_reaudit": false,
                "url": "https://p.brilig.com/contact/bct?pid=${P1}&_ct=pixel&adid=${CP_ID}&action=1"
            },
            ...
        ],
        "dbg_info": {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

The Evidon AdChoices Icon pixel is the first in the response. You note that id is 1. You also note that num_required_params is 2. This means that, when adding the pixel to your creative, you must provide values for {P1} and {P2} in the pixel content.

Then you create the JSON-formatted file for adding the pixel to the creative. In the file, you set pixel_template_id to 2, and you set param_1 and param_2 to the values for {P1} and {P2} in the pixel content.

> [!NOTE]
> The pixels array will be completely overwritten with the information in this file. Therefore, if the creative already includes any pixels, be sure to specify them in the file as well.


``` 
$ cat creative_update
{
    "creative": {
        "pixels": [
            {
                "pixel_template_id": 1,
                "param_1":"12",
                "param_2":"34"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Finally, you make a PUT call to update the creative. The pixels array in the response then shows that the pixel has been added. The two parameters are defined and have been populated in the pixel content. Note that, because the Evidon AdChoices Icon pixel does **not** cause the creative to require re-auditing, audit_status has not be reverted to "pending".

``` 
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X PUT -d @creative_update 'https://api.adnxs.com/creative/3/503577'
{
    "response": {
        "status": "OK",

                     \"></scr'+'ipt>');}());"
                }
            ],
            ...
        },
        "dbg_info": {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

## Adding a custom pixel to a creative

In this example, the PUT request adds a custom url-js pixel to creative 503577. In the JSON-formatted file, the format is set to "url-js", and the url is set to the location of the JavaScript that you want to serve with the creative. Note in the response that audit_status is "pending"; this is because adding a custom pixel to a creative causes the creative to be resubmitted for audit.

> [!NOTE]
> The pixels array will be completely overwritten with the information in this file. Therefore, if the creative already includes any pixels, be sure to specify them in the file as well.

**Determining the Technical Atttributes assigned to your creative**

Although technical attributes isn't something that can be added to the automated reports today, this can be retrieved through the Creative service in the bidder API. For more information please refer to the [Technical Attribute Service](technical-attribute-service.md)

This can be accessed by adding the query string parameter "?attributes=true" as: "[adnxs.com/creative/MEMBER_ID/CREATIVE_ID?attributes=true](https://api.adnxs.com/creative/MEMBER_ID/CREATIVE_ID?attributes=true)"

``` 
"technical_attributes": [
{
 "id": 2,
 "name": "Flash"
},
{
 "id": 9,
"name": "Initial Load > 40kb"
},
 {
  "id": 13,
  "name": "Banner has AdChoices Icon"
 },
 {
  "id": 15,
  "name": "Animated: 15 seconds or less"
 }
 ]
```

The [Meta Service](https://api.adnxs.com/creative/MEMBER_ID/CREATIVE_ID?attributes=true) provides the most up to date information about interfacing with objects in our API.

**Creative Macros**

The impression bus supports two types of creative macros replaced in real time: pre-defined **Xandrcreative macros** and **custom macros** that can be defined by the bidder. The main difference between the two is the perspective. For example, the impression bus has no knowledge of a Campaign or an Insertion Order when a real time bid is placed, so any objects supported with a bidder's internal object model and required in a macro should be supported using custom macros.

> [!WARNING]
> Macro Restrictions
>
> - Only pre-defined Xandr macros and custom macros are supported when registering creatives.
>
> - DO NOT use OpenRTB macros when registering creatives. OpenRTB macros are for use only in the [bid response](incoming-bid-response-from-bidders.md).
> - Do not give a custom macro a name that matches the name of an OpenRTB macro.

**Xandr creative macros**

See [Xandr Macros](xandr-macros.md) for a complete list of the available creative macros.

**Click Tracking Example**:

``` 
"media_url": "https://ad.doubleclick.net/adi/N5364.Ivillage.com/B2965815.5;sz=728x90;click0=${CLICK_URL};ord=${CACHEBUSTER}?"
```

**Custom Macros**

Using custom_macro functionality in the [Bid Response](incoming-bid-response-from-bidders.md), you can dynamically pass into the pre-registered creatives. For instance, if you wanted to always return a particular campaign and reporting code, you could set up your creative as follows:

``` 
{
   "creative":{
       "media_url":"https://adserver.com/imp?z=300x250;camp=${CAMPAIGN_ID};int=${INT_CODE}",
       "format":"url-html",
       "width":"300",
       "height":"250"
}}
```

Then, when your bidder responds to an auction, the bid response can
specify the name and value of the macros to replace, by including, for
example:

``` 
"custom_macros":[
{
   "name":"CAMPAIGN_ID",
   "value":"452346"
},
{
   "name":"INT_CODE",
   "value":"a352-45we-sdr3"
}]
```

> [!NOTE]
> Even if the value is an integer, it must be placed within quotation marks (for example,  `"42"`).
