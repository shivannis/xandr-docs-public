| `buyer_media_cost_direct_cleared` | money | `123.45` | buyer_media_cost on imps_direct_cleared | The buyer's spend for impressions where the seller payment is transacted directly between this buyer-seller pair, not through Xandr. |
| `buyer_media_cost_direct_cleared_buying_currency` | money | `123.45` | buyer_media_cost_direct_cleared_buying_currency | The buyer's spend for impressions where the seller payment is transacted directly between this buyer-seller pair, not through Xandr, in the transaction currency the buyer used to buy the impression. |
| `buyer_media_cost_appnexus_cleared` | money | `123.45` | buyer_media_cost on imps_appnexus_cleared | The buyer's spend for impressions where Xandr pays out the seller payment. |

| `creative_overage_fees_buying_currency` | money | `123.45` | creative_overage_fees_buying_currency | Total fees charged for hosted creatives that exceed the creative size limit, in the transaction currency the buyer used to buy the impression. |
| `auction_service_fees` | money | `123.45` | auction_service_fees | The fee charged on RTB bought impressions specified in the buyer member's contract. For example, with a 10% fee, if the buyer spends $1,000 on inventory, Xandr charges them a $100 fee. They will receive an invoice for $1,000 of Media Cost and $100 for Buyer Auction Service Charge (BASC) for a total of $1,100.<br><br>There are two types:<br> - For rows that are direct_cleared, your direct clear fee would be recorded in this field.<br> - If you have your Buyer Auction Service Charge (BASC) set as a fee rather than a deduction, a value will be recorded here as well. You can differentiate by grouping by the direct_cleared dimension when you pull the report. |

Creative Auction Service Change (CASC) will also be represented here. For the example above, the buyer will receive an invoice for $1,000 of Media Cost, which is inclusive of the deduction Xandr charges.<br><br>**Warning:** This field matches auction_service_fees if your contract has a Buyer Auction Service Charge (BASC) rate of greater than 0%. |
| `auction_service_deduction_buying_currency` | money | `123.45` | auction_service_deduction_buying_currency | The deduction on RTB bought impressions specified in the buyer member's contract, in the transaction currency the buyer used to buy the impression. |

## Example

### Create the JSON-formatted report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` `bidder_pricing_report`, as well as the `columns` (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (year, month, day),
and specify the format in which the data should be returned (csv, excel, or html). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](report-service.md).

``` 
$ cat buyer_invoice_report_request.json
{
    "report": {
        "format": "csv",
        "report_interval": "last_48_hours",
        "columns": [
            "seller_member_name",
            "buyer_member_name",
            "imps"
        ],
        "report_type": "bidder_pricing_report"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the reporting service

``` 
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @bidder_pricing_report_request.json 'https://api.adnxs.com/report'
{
 "response": {
   "status": "OK",
   "report_id": "39c4855a07e92433947886b5aabd267d", <=== COPY THIS report_id as you will need it to check the status of your report and to download your report
   "existing": false,
   "dbg_info": {
     ...
     }
   }
 }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service

Make a `GET` call with the Report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

``` 
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.adnxs.com/report?id=39c4855a07e92433947886b5aabd267d'
{
 "response": {
   "status": "OK",
   "report": {
     "name": null,
     "created_on": "2015-11-17 21:27:21",
     "cache_hit": false,
     "fact_cache_hit": false,
     "fact_cache_error": null,
     "json_request": "{\"report\":{\"format\":\"csv\",\"report_interval\":\"last_48_hours\",\"columns\":[\"seller_member_name\",\"buyer_member_name\",\"imps\",\"report_type\":\"bidder_pricing_report\"}}",
     "header_info": "Report ID:,39c4855a07e92433947886b5aabd267d\r\nRun at:,2015-11-17 21:27:21\r\nStart date:,2015-11-15 21:00:00\r\nEnd date:,2015-11-17 20:00:00\r\nTimezone:,\r\nUser:,Huanqing Liu (171989)\r\n",
     "row_count": "309",
     "report_size": "15583",
     "internal_info": "{...}",
     "user_id": "171989",
     "entity_id": "0",
     "started_on": "2015-11-17 21:27:22",
     "finished_on": "2015-11-17 21:27:24",
     "query_time": "0",
     "url": "report-download?id=39c4855a07e92433947886b5aabd267d"
   },
   "execution_status": "ready",
   "_was_this_status_cached_": 0,
   "dbg_info": {
     ...
     }
   }
 }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the Report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and Report ID in the `url` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!NOTE]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use \\i or \\v in your call to expose the response header.

``` 
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.adnxs.com/report-download?id=39c4855a07e92433947886b5aabd267d' > bidder_pricing_report.csv
```
