# Xandr macros

Macros are used to populate URLs (such as those found in creatives) with useful information.  They are essentially variables that are expanded by our ad server with whatever their actual value is at the time of the ad call.

This page contains information about all of the macros we support.  For each macro, we list the information that that macro is replaced with during the ad call.

> [!TIP]
> For more control over URL encoding and decoding, see the section on [Function Macros](xandr-macros.md#function-macros).
>
> For additional examples about how macros may be > used when uploading creatives, refer to the 
> [Creative Service](creative-service.md) page.

## Creative macros

> [!WARNING]
>  OpenRTB macros (like `${AUCTION_PRICE`}) are not supported when adding creatives using the [Creative Service](creative-service.md). They are only supported on the [Bid Response](incoming-bid-response-from-bidders.md).

Xandr supports the following creative macros when adding creatives using the [Creative Service](creative-service.md).

## Function macros

A function macro a special kind of macro that performs a function on another macro. Function macros can be used in combination with any other creative macro, including custom macros, although if they are not recognized at render time, they will not be translated and the function will not be called.

Xandr currently supports the `{$URL_ENC}` function macro, which can be used for a variety of purposes related to encoding.  A key use case is when a URL needs to be passed from ad server to ad server via a creative macro, and due to the presence of unsupported characters in standard URL formatting, must be encoded at various steps of the process.

The macro takes the following form:

```
 ${URL_ENC(${MACRO_NAME},#)} 
```

where `${MACRO_NAME}` is the macro to be encoded and \# is the integer `1`, `2`, or `3`, representing the number of times to encode the contents. Note that more than three encodings are not supported.

> [!NOTE]
> Each encoding corresponds to a step in the redirect chain, as well as how a given third-party click
> tracker works with the macro. Double encoding will usually be needed for final destination URLs when a second ad server is involved, and triple encoding for a third ad server.
> 
> To determine whether you will need to use single, double, or triple encoding, you should check with your third-party click tracker and then test your `URL_ENC` macro to ensure it works. If your macro is not
> working, one consequence of this may be link breakage, which will result in users not reaching the intended destination URL.

## Encoding examples

**To encode click URL once:**

```
${URL_ENC(${CLICK_URL},1)} 
```

If  `https://xandr.com` is passed as the click URL, using `${URL_ENC(${CLICK_URL},1)}` to single encode the URL would result in `https%3A%2F%2Fxandr.com`  populating the creative.

**To encode media URL once:**

```
 ${URL_ENC(${MEDIA_URL},1)} 
```

**To encode media URL twice:**

```
 ${URL_ENC(${MEDIA_URL},2)} 
```

**To encode a custom macro called ADFORMAT once:**

```
${URL_ENC(${ADFORMAT},1)}
```
