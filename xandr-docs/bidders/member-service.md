# Bidders - Member service

> [!NOTE]
> Members are integrated into Xandr's system and managed via the Member Service.

Any entity that has a financial relationship with Xandr's platform (usually a buyer or seller) needs to be added to Xandr's system as a
"member" before they can conduct transactions. Members can be registered with the Member Service either by a bidder or by Xandr personnel.

## Members and contracts

Before they can buy or sell ads, a member needs a contract with Xandr. This contract will establish financial terms and credit facilities (if applicable), and bind the member to the terms and conditions of Xandr, such as content quality and use of personally identifiable information. Any bidder can create a member at any time, but members will not be able to place bids until their contract has been approved.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If you are looking for information about other platform members use the [Platform Member Service](member-service.md).
> - In bidder sandbox environments, all functionality of the Member Service is available.
> - The Member Service does not grant API access. That is done via the [User Service](user-service.md).

### Platform exposure

The platform exposure setting determines how your account is displayed to other members on the platform. There are three values which result in slightly different behaviors as outlined below:

| Platform Exposure Value | Behavior |
|:---|:---|
| `hidden` | Member is not displayed.<br><br>**Note:** Setting `platform_exposure` to `"hidden"` will hide your member `"name"` and `"domain"` fields in our [sellers.json](https://xandr.com/sellers.json) file and list your member seat as `"is_confidential": 1`. For example, see [`hidden` example](#hidden-example).<br>This can limit the monetization of your inventory as some DSPs may not choose to buy impressions from sellers who are not transparent in the `"schain"` object. |
| `private` | Member is displayed as "Member 123" where 123 is the member ID. |
| `public` | Member is displayed using the billing name.<br><br>**Note:** Setting `platform_exposure` to `"public"` will display your member `"name"` and `"domain"` fields in our [sellers.json](https://xandr.com/sellers.json) file. For example, see [`public` example](#public-example). |

#### `hidden` example

```

{
  "seller_id": "8253",
  "is_confidential": 1,
  "seller_type": "PUBLISHER"
}

```

#### `public` example

```

{
  "seller_id": "7694",
  "seller_type": "INTERMEDIARY",
  "domain": "groupm.com",
  "name": "Xaxis – Slovakia Marketplace"
}

```

The sample JSON below shows how to set this parameter.

```
{
  "member": {
    "platform_exposure": "public"
  }
}
```

## Authentication token

Authentication is always the first step when using the API Services. The authentication token can then be written to our cookie file for future use. For more detailed instructions, see [Authentication Service](authentication-service.md).

## Examples

### Create a JSON-formatted file describing the member

The only required fields are `billing_name` and `bidder_id` if the member is associated with a bidder, but since a member has a financial
relationship with Xandr, you will probably want to include other billing-related information.

```
$ cat member
{
        "member" : {
                "active" : true,
                "billing_name" : "My Company",
                "bidder_id" : 2,
                "billing_address_1" : "One Coke Way",
                "billing_city" : "Atlanta",
                "billing_region" : "GA",
                "billing_country" : "US",
        "email_code" : "cola"
        }
}
```

### Add the member file to the impression bus cache

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST --data-binary @member 'https://api.adnxs.com/member'
{
        "response":{
                "status":"OK","id":1
        }
}
```

### Now modify the member via a modified JSON-formatted file

```
$ cat member_mod
{
        "member" : {
                "active" : true,
                "billing_name" : "My Company",
                "bidder_id" : 2,
                "billing_address_1" : "Building 5",
                "billing_address_2" : "Company Complex",
                "billing_city" : "Atlanta",
                "billing_region" : "GA",
                "billing_country" : "US",
                "billing_postal_code" : "33608"
        }
}
```

### Update the member information in the impression bus cache, using the member ID

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies-X PUT --data-binary @member_mod 'https://api.adnxs.com/member/1'
{
        "response":{
                "status":"OK"
        }
}
```

### View information about the member

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.adnxs.com/member/1'
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "member": {
        "id": 334,
        "agent_id": null,
        "code": null,
        "active": true,
        "buyer_credit_limit": 0,
        "billing_name" : "My Company",
                "bidder_id" : 2,
                "billing_address_1" : "Building 5",
                "billing_address_2" : "Company Complex",
                "billing_city" : "Atlanta",
                "billing_region" : "GA",
                "billing_country" : "US",
                "billing_postal_code" : "33608"
        "email_code": "cola",
        "seller_revshare_pct": 95,
        "price_buckets": [
        ],
        "default_tag_id": null,
        "default_ad_profile_id": 251,
        "buyer_clearing_fee_pct": null,
        "serving_domain": {
          "cname": null,
          "type": null
        },
        "last_activity": "2010-04-08 03:38:16",
        "timezone": "EST5EDT"
      }
   }
}
```
