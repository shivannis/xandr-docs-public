# Bidders - Postal code service

The Postal Code Service is a read-only service. This service can be used to retrieve postal code IDs that are registered with Xandr for geography targeting purposes when setting up a line item or for configuring reports that support that dimension. The main use case for the Postal Code Service is to keep your postal code database up-to-date with Xandr's. To access the changes that were made to the Xandr database since the last call that you made to the service, make sure to use the `min_last_modified` field in your call.

> [!WARNING]
> Due to the large number of GET calls you would need to make to obtain a complete list of postal codes (as a result of pagination), we recommend the following:
>
> - create a cache and populate it with a GET call for all objects on the service
> - then, for subsequent GET calls, use the `min_last_modified` filter to obtain updates (once per hour or once per day, since postal codes are updated infrequently)
>
> You should only omit the `min_last_modified` filter if you are querying this service for the first time.
