# Supply types

Clicking the **Supply Types** tab accesses a screen where you can select which supply types you want. By default, all supply types are included: **Web**, **Mobile Web**, and **App (CTV, Mobile)**. You can toggle each of these on or off.

When you close the **Supply Types** tab, a summary is shown in the upper right-hand corner of the **Supply Types** display bar that shows that you've applied some sort of targeting. (*Example: Web and Mobile App Included*).

> [!NOTE]
> Ad Types and Supply Types are the only two targeting options that by default show some sort of targeting summary in the upper right-hand corner of their display bars.
