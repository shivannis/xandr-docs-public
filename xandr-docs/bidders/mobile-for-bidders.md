# Mobile for bidders

Buying mobile inventory is very similar to buying other seller-specific external supply on Xandr. This page walks you through the process.

> [!NOTE]
> For full bid request documentation, see [Bid Request](outgoing-bid-request-to-bidders.md).

## Creative specifications

At this time, only creatives conforming to the following specifications can serve on mobile inventory:

- **Type**
  - Standard Banners, including MRAID
  - Additional rich media creative types will be supported in the future
- **Size**
  - 300x50
  - 300x250
  - 320x50
  - 728x90
- **Format**
  - Html
  - JavaScript
  - Image (jpg, gif, png)

## Buying mobile inventory

- [Step 1: Ensure that you accept mobile bid requests](#step-1-ensure-that-you-accept-mobile-bid-requests)
- [Step 2: Target and bid on mobile inventory](#step-2-target-and-bid-on-mobile-inventory)
- [Step 3: Receive auction results](#step-3-receive-auction-results)

### Step 1: Ensure that you accept mobile bid requests

Bidder profiles allow you to filter for the bid requests that you want to receive. To accept mobile bid requests, you must allow the following values within an existing bidder profile or create a new bidder profile specifically for mobile bid requests:

| Field | Value |
|:---|:---|
| `supply_type` | `"mobile_app"`, `"mobile_web"` |

For more details about updating or creating bidder profiles, see [Legacy Bidder Profile Service](legacy-bidder-profile-service.md).

### Step 2: Target and bid on mobile inventory

When Xandr receives an impression from mobile supply sources, Xandr routes these through a publisher, site, and tag ID combination, in increasing order of granularity. The Xandr bid request includes these IDs, allowing you to target specific slices of mobile inventory.
For more information on the content of the inventory, contact your Xandr representative.

The Xandr bid request for a mobile impression includes other fields that may be useful for your bidder to target. These fields include:

- `operating_system`
- `browser`
- `language`
- `ip_address`
- `device_make`
- `device_model`
- `device_type`
- `device_ids`
- `carrier`
- `loc` (only available on small percentage of impressions)
- `app_id`

### Step 3: Receive auction results

The Xandr Notify request is essential to tracking when an impression is served, the win price of the impression, and to provide you with any custom notify data you may have included with the bid.

## Fields supported by mobile bid requests

- [Mobile-specific data](#mobile-specific-data)
- [Device IDs](#device-ids)
