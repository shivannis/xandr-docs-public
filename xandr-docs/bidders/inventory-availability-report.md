# Bidder - Inventory Availability report

Inventory Availability report offers insight into the types of inventory available on the platform. These reports are available by request only; use the [support portal](https://help.xandr.com/s/login/). Due to the structure of our impression availability databases, reporting dimensions are limited to those outlined below. Also note:

- Our databases contain 30 days worth of historical inventory availability data. Reports are therefore limited to this timeframe.
- Additional reporting restrictions may apply to mobile impressions. Contact your Xandr representative for further information.

## Time frame

You can run this report for a custom time frame, set the `start_date` and `end_date` fields in your report request. For more details about these fields, see [Report Service](./report-service.md).

### Data retention period

Data in this report is retained for 30 days.

## Example

### Create the JSON-formatted report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` of `"platform_inventory_availability"`, as well as the `columns` (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the `format` in which the data should be returned (`csv`, `excel`, or `html`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md).

```
$ cat platform_inventory_availability

{
    "report": {
        "columns": [
            "day",
            "seller_member_name",
            "audit_type",
            "size",
            "device_type",
            "operating_system_family",
            "geo_country",
            "imps"
        ],
        "format": "csv",
        "report_interval": "today",
        "report_type": "platform_inventory_availability"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the report service

```
$ curl -b cookies -X POST -d @platform_inventory_availability 'https://api.appnexus.com/report'

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"6b177543a9411ffa67b09bdf5e76cac1"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=6b177543a9411ffa67b09bdf5e76cac1'
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report":{
         "name":null,
         "created_on":"2020-08-25 13:03:37",
         "json_request":"{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"platform_inventory_availability\",\"columns\":[\"day\",\"seller_member_name\",\"audit_type\",\"imps\",\"size\",\"device_type\,\"operating_system_family\,\"geo_country\"],\"report_interval\":\"today\",\"format\":\"csv\",\"grouping\":{\"additional_grouping_sets\":[],\"unselected_implicit_groupings\":[],\"additional_groups_on_bottom\":true},\"timezone\":\"UTC\",\"filters\":[{\"device_type\":\"123456\"}],\"reporting_decimal_type\":\"decimal\",\"use_cache\":true},\"extraction_version\":\"refactored\",\"end_date\":1598400000,\"start_date\":1598313600,\"user_id\":\"987654\"}",
         "url": "report-download?id=6b177543a9411ffa67b09bdf5e76cac1"
      },
      "execution_status":"ready"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the Report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and Report ID in the `url` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!NOTE]
> - If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.
>
> - There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.

$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=6b177543a9411ffa67b09bdf5e76cac1' > /tmp/platform_inventory_availability.csv
