# Exchanges and members

## Workflow

Clicking the **Exchanges and Members** tab accesses a screen where you can select which exchanges and members you want. You can either **include** or **exclude** the desired exchanges by clicking either the **green checkmark icon** (include), or the **red minus sign icon** (exclude).

> [!NOTE]
> For some exchanges, it is allowed to also include/exclude specific members. Other exchanges do not have this option. In this case, the `include`/`exclude` options will be disabled.

Click on the **arrow** to the right of the **Name** entry to access a list of members in that exchange. You can then select the members you want.

When you close the **Exchanges and Members** tab, a summary is shown in the upper right-hand corner of the **Exchanges and Members** display bar that shows that you've applied some sort of targeting.

## About exchanges

Exchanges are groups of sellers (members) organized to allow for easier supply targeting.

- Targeting an exchange will include or exclude traffic from all of its members. You can combine exchange targeting with domain list targeting and/or member targeting.
- As new sellers are added, you do not have to update your profile or targeting. When targeting a single exchange, you will receive all members within it and any new members that join.
- The Microsoft Monetize supply exchange includes inventory that represents the most direct path to supply. This inventory is brought to you directly through the Xandr SSP technology.  
  - You can find out more information about Microsoft Monetize supply here: [Microsoft Monetize Supply for External Demand Partners](xandr-monetize-supply-for-external-demand-partners.md).
- Sellers that belong to the Microsoft Monetize supply exchange cannot be individually included and excluded.
