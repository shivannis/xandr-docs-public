# Bidders - Deal from package service

A package is a deal that a seller is prepared to offer to any buyer. Buyer members use the [Package Buyer Access Service](package-buyer-access-service.md) to browse available packages and find one that meets their needs. Then buyers use the Deal From Package service to generate a deal between themselves and the seller.

Once you have generated a deal, you can view deal details including description and deal pricing using the [Deal Buyer Access Service](deal-buyer-access-service.md).
