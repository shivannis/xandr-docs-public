# March 9, 2016 - Creative macro breaking change

We are making a breaking change to deprecate the `${REFERER_URL}` macro, effective 60 days from today, on **May 8, 2016**.

AppNexus will continue to support the encoded version of this macro, `${REFERER_URL_ENC}`, where it is necessary to have referrer information passed back to a third-party source. Ensure that your system configuration is updated to use only the encoded URL macro.

For more information about what constitutes a breaking change, see our [Breaking Changes Policy](../digital-platform-api/breaking-changes.md). If you have any questions about this change, then reach out to your AppNexus representative.
