# Outgoing bid request to bidders

> [!NOTE]
> This describes the integration of the [OpenRTB 2.4 protocol](https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OpenRTB-API-Specification-Version-2-4-FINAL.pdf).

This bid request is sent to bidders whenever an ad call reaches the impression bus. It contains all the necessary information for a bidder to produce a bid price and a creative to serve.

The bid request includes information from sellers that specifies which advertisers and creatives are allowed to win an auction and run on a page.

> [!NOTE]
> You may not wish to receive all bid requests that pass through our platform. You can either throttle requests by some percentage, or filter requests by preset criteria such as geography.
