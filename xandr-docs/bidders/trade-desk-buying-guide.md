# Trade desk buying guide

## Overview

Xandr, in partnership with Trade Desk, has created this buying guide to help Xandr publishers communicate with their buyers about accessing and targeting Xandr's publisher inventory using Trade Desk as their DSP. The information has been created in collaboration with and approved by the Trade Desk team. Note that platforms can and will change regularly, and as always with our documentation we will do our best to update this guide as needed. We recommend that if buyers are having issues or need help with using the Trade Desk platform their first point of outreach should be the Trade Desk team.

### Step 5: Target and launch the deal

Find the deal by searching by deal ID or deal name. Once fetched, target the deal ID within the **Private Contract** rail at the Ad Group level. Note that, it is possible to target more than one private contract in a single Ad Group. Once the deal is trafficked in the SSP, your Ad Group will automatically start spending according to the requirements.

## Programmatic guaranteed (PG) workflow

## Tips and tricks for PG workflow

- For PG deals with **GAM**, **Magnite**, **Freewheel**, or **Bidswitch**, the client will utilize the Easy Proposal Activation workflow described above.
- If the SSP is not **GAM**, **Magnite**, **Freewheel**, or **Bidswitch**, the publisher will provide the client with the targetable deal ID so the client can create the PG contract in The Trade Desk platform.

 > [!NOTE]
 > A few best practices for clients:
 >
 > - Make sure to leverage the The Trade Desk’s PG workflow on the platform.
 > - Ensure that there are no daily spend caps on the Ad Group or Campaign level.
 > - Confirm that the Ad Groups are in active state.
 > - Make sure that the agreed ad sizes are trafficked at the Ad Group level.
 > - Make it certain that all parties are aligned on the budget. Ensure that the client’s creative meets the specs outline by the publisher and that the creative is uploaded 24-48 hours before the launch date.

:::image type="content" source="media/trade-desk-buying-guide-fig-t.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Private Contract rail in your Ad Group where you click Troubleshoot.":::

:::image type="content" source="media/trade-desk-buying-guide-fig-u.png" alt-text="Screenshot to see the ISSUE, DETAILS, POTENTIAL SOLUTION, and EXCLUDED PERCENTAGE of bids for a specific contract.":::

The **Bid Exclusions Reasons** dialog would appear. You can

|  |  |
|--|--|
| Contract Dropdown | Switch between contracts assigned to your Ad Group by selecting a different name from this dropdown. Select All Contracts to see reasons across all deals in your Ad Group. |
| Deal | Select a specific deal for the contract in question or choose **All** to see issues from all deals associated with the contract. |
| Date | Select a date range to filter issues. |
| View Contract Details | Click this link to be taken to the Settings page for the contract in question. |
| Percentage Indicator | Use this bar to compare the percentage of bids excluded to the percentage of bid served. |

### Common reasons for bid exclusions and their troubleshooting

| Common Reason for Bid Exclusion | The Trade Desk Definition | The Trade Desk Suggestion |
|--|--|--|
| Creative Not Eligible | An issue with the creative’s approval status, attributes, or settings prevented a bid response from being served. | Check if the creative is being blocked on the publisher’s end due to category or block advertiser restrictions. Have the publisher check with the supply vendor that the creative ID isn’t being excluded from the auction and has been approved by the supply vendor. Confirm that the necessary media types are included in the creative. |
| No Creatives of Correct Type Found | The Ad Group has no creatives of the correct type (display, video, native, audio) matching the bid request. | Ensure the creatives assigned to your Ad Group match the creative types coming through the contract details. For example, if you have video creatives assigned to your Ad Group, confirm that video inventory is coming through the deal and if the publisher accepts VAST or VPAID. |
| No Matching Ad Format Found | The Ad Group does not have a creative assigned with an ad format matching the bid request. | Make sure that all creatives assigned to your Ad Group match the creative sizes coming through the contract details. For example, if the publisher is sending 970x250 and 728x90 desktop display inventory, ensure that you have 970x250 and 728x90 creatives assigned to your Ad Group. |
| Referrer Data Missing | A pre-bid solution such as DoubleVerify, Grapeshot, IAS or Peer39 blocked the request. | Consider loosening or lifting pre-bid solutions as they may be restricting the number of requests. |
| User Doesn’t Match Audience Targeting | The Ad Group is targeting an audience and there was no match found with the bid request. | Confirm with the publisher the avails for the audience in which you’re targeting. Consider expanding the audience targeting so scale is not limited. |

### Common questions asked while troubleshooting

| Questions | Response |
|--|--|
| Is the advertiser’s audience targeting too specific and therefore restricting bidding? | Remaining Addressable Market (RAM) shows how many imps are available to bid on after the Ad Group’s targets and rails have been applied. The lower the score, the more restrictive; the higher the score, the less restrictive. Common Targeting Parameters: Audience, Geo, Brand Safety & Measurement, Device. |
| Did the publisher increase the deal floor and you are now bidding below the floor? | Confirm the floor price listed in the deal. |
| Did the publisher shift the inventory to a different SSP? | Check if you are seeing avails come through the deal. If it’s a First Party 1:1 deal, reach out to the publisher directly; if it’s a Third Party PMP Library deal, reach out to your Account Manager. |
| Is there an issue if avails, and winning bids, are coming through a Third Party PMP Library deal ID but there’s not much spend? | Our buyers are self-service and will make the decision as to when/if they activate their campaigns against certain supply types.<br>We encourage the publishers’ sales team to share the deal private contract links with any clients you are contacting. The link will drive buyers with logins to our platform closer to the point of spend activation on the Third Party PMP Library deals. Please note that you will not be able to view the links, but our clients should have access.<br>You may see more adoption in client First Party 1:1 deals after setting up Third Party PMP Library deals. The 1:1 deals will likely drive more revenue, but we see value in the PMP Library deals since they allow newer and smaller agencies to access your inventory. |

> [!NOTE]
> The above troubleshooting steps are general in nature. Your Account Manager and The Trade Desk Knowledge Portal are the best resources for assistance with PMP deals and the Trade Desk platform.
