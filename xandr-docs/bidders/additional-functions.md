## Activate/Deactivate button

The **Activate/Deactivate** button is located in the upper right-hand corner of the **Profiles** screen. It displays activate or deactivate, depending on the state that it is currently in:

- If it is displaying **Activate**, the profile is currently inactive.
- If it displays **Deactivate**, the profile is currently active.

## Duplicate button

The **Duplicate** button is located in the upper right-hand corner of the **Profiles** screen. Clicking it will allow you to save it as a new profile. When you click **Save**, the profile appears as a new, distinct profile in the table on the left. The settings will be the same as for the profile that was duplicated.

Most bidders change the **Name** of the profile. A suggested name will appear, which is usually changed by the bidder.
