# Ad Types



Clicking the Ad Types tab accesses
a screen where you can select which ad types you want to receive. By
default, all ad types are included: Banner, Video, Native, and
Audio. You can remove specific ad types by **unchecking** the
appropriate box. Ad types are sometimes removed to receive specific
types of inventory. *(Example: Video and Audio).*

## Banner Sizes

- When targeting **Banner** ad type, you can make additional granular ad
  size targeting.
- Selecting **Specific Sizes** accesses a menu where **Standard** sizes
  are shown in the left-hand column for you to select. When selected,
  they are moved to the Selected
  column to the right.
- You can also add in custom sizes on the bottom of the screen by
  entering in
  the Width and Height, and
  clicking the Add Size button.

When you close the Ad Types tab, a
summary is shown in the upper right-hand corner of the Ad Types display
bar that shows that you've applied some sort of targeting. *(Example:
Audio, Native, and Video Included).*



Note: Ad
Types and Supply Types are the
only two targeting options that by default show some sort of targeting
summary in the upper right-hand corner of their display bars.
