# forceCreativeId for iOS

A forceCreativeId specifies the ID of a creative that should be forced to appear in a placement. It is used to request for the desired creative to display. Forcing a creative allows you to preview an ad on a site, perform testing or certification, and create tear sheets. This API is available for banner, interstitial, native and InstreamVideo creatives.

> [!NOTE]
> The scope of the forceCreativeId is limited to debug or testing purposes. You should never use it in a production environment.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Attribute | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `forceCreativeId` | Integer | readwrite, assign | Indicates the id of creative that is to be assigned to appear in a placement. |

//Interstitial
ANInterstitialAd *interstitialAd = [[ANInterstitialAd alloc] initWithPlacementId:@"1"];
