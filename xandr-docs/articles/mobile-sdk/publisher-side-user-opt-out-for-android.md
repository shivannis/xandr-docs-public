# Publisher side user opt-out for Android

## Overview

The publisher side user opt-out feature provides a new API call in Mobile SDK which enables the publishers to set the information of  users' choice of opt-in/out from tracking in the `AdRequests`. For any `AdRequest`, Xandr Mobile SDK checks in the device or OS environment level and populates the value for `limitAdTracking` (LMT) in the background automatically (If LMT=true, it indicates that the user opts out from tracking at the device or OS settings). However, the publishers retain information about their users' opt-in/out of tracking and thus required to pass that information if their user has opted out to comply with their privacy regulations. To facilitate the same, publisher side user opt-out feature is introduced in Mobile SDK.

## Methods

### setDoNotTrack

Setter method which enables the publisher side user opt-out feature.

```
/**
 Do not track flag. Set this to true/false if you have information in the app about user opt-out.
 If set to true, tracking cookies and AAID will be disabled for all future auctions.
 Default value is false.
 */
public static void setDoNotTrack(boolean dnt) {
    Settings.getSettings().doNotTrack = dnt;
}
```

### getDoNotTrack

Getter method which indicates whether the tracking is enabled or not.

```
/**
     * Returns true if Do not track is enabled.
     * False otherwise.
     */
    public static boolean getDoNotTrack() {
        return Settings.getSettings().doNotTrack;
    }
```

## Example

```
//Setter
SDKSettings.setDoNotTrack(true);
//Getter
SDKSettings.getDoNotTrack();
```
