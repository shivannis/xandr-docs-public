# OTT and CTV video integrations

Xandr supports integrations with various OTT hardware platforms, including CTV, to enable client-side ad insertion through tags or client-side SDKs. Currently, AppleTV is the only platform that is supported with an SDK.

Additional OTT-capable device SDKs are in development. If you're interested in developing an integration for a different platform, contact your Xandr representative about beta programs for these upcoming integrations.
