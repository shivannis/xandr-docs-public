# Anatomy of the audience planner page

The Audience Planner page on the **Products** tab shows an analysis of how products in your network overlap.

## About the audience planner interface

The Audience Planner page is comprised of the following four panels:

- **Configuration** – This panel, on the top left side of the page, is where you select the main criteria for your lookup. This includes the product or target attribute you want to analyze (i.e., the focus), and the metric you want to use for your analysis (overlapping impressions or audience index).  

- **Filters** – This panel, which appears beneath the Configuration panel, is where you can narrow your analysis by time period, product group, target attribute, parent product, product type, and overlap type.  

- **Analysis** – This is the main panel on the Audience Planner page. It is populated with the products that meet the criteria and filters you selected in the Configuration and Filters panels.

    > [!NOTE]
    > By default, this panel is displayed in a chart view, with each bar in the chart representing an overlapping product based on the primary metric you selected. To see overlapping impressions and audience index values side by side, as well as capacity, availability, sell-through rate, and more for each overlapping product, view the analysis in a table (referred to as list view) by clicking above the Configuration panel. From the list view, you can also check availability based on overlapping products.

- **Product** – This panel, which appears when you click a product in the Analysis panel, shows high-level information about the product. This includes the product type, rate card, status, and targeting characteristics.

    > [!NOTE]
    > - Change the analysis to focus on the selected product by clicking **Set as Focus**.
    > - Make the selected product the baseline for audience index analysis by clicking **Set as Baseline**.
    > - View the full details of the selected product by clicking **Product Visibility**.
