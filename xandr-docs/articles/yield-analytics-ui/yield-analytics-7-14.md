## Find products

- Additional Metrics are now configurable, which includes metrics that we have previously shown as meta data. The reasoning is that Services/Clients find that data helpful when exporting.
- Export will only export what is currently shown in the table, and not all meta data - as was done previously. The new mechanism is consistent with Reports, where what you see in the table is what is exported. The format for the export on the Find Products page is now consistent with the export format for Reports.
- The look and feel is nearly identical to Reports. This is also for consistency.
- The selection of a product behaves the same as the Reports page i.e. a dialog is launched where meta data, characteristics, product group can be viewed, as well as permissioned buttons to navigate to other locations.

## New landing page for find
