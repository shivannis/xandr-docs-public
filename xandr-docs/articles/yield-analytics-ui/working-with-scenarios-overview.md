# Working with scenarios overview

Use Scenario Manager to run simulations of how modifications to an order line would affect its delivery, as well as the delivery of any competing and overlapping order lines.

Scenario Manager is most commonly used to troubleshoot order line delivery. Ad operations traffickers and account managers use it to solve order line pacing issues. Sales planners use it to analyze a proposal before it is sent to a potential client.

Scenario Manager doesn't have its own tab, but you can access it at any time from the Scenario link.
