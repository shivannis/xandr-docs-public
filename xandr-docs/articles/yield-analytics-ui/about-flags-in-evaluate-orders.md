# About flags in evaluate orders

Use the flags in Evaluate Orders to find and resolve potential availability and pricing issues related to the line items on each proposal.

## Types of flags

There are three types of flags in Evaluate Orders:

- ! Price flags (CPM order lines only) indicate when the sold CPM value is either below the floor price or below the configured discount threshold.
- ! Avails flags indicate that a line item is targeting a product that does not have enough available impressions to accommodate the order line.
- ! Sellthru flags indicate that an order line is targeting a product that is more than 50% sold through, though the percentage is configurable for your agency.
