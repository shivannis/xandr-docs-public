# Schedule a report to be sent

When you email a report to yourself or designated recipients, you can send it immediately or on a recurring schedule.

1. Create a new report or open an existing one, and then save it. Only saved reports can be scheduled.
1. On the toolbar, click **Send**. The **Send Analysis** dialog appears.
1. On the **Recurrence** dropdown list, select how frequently you want the report to be sent, or select **None** to send the report immediately without scheduling it.
1. In the **Send To box**, enter the email address for each recipient, separating each address with a comma. You can include up to 50 email addresses. To send a report to more than 50 addresses, use a distribution list.
1. (Optional) In the **Message** box, type any comments you want to include in the email.
1. (Optional) As needed, clear the checkboxes for items to be included in the email.
    - If you're sharing the report with someone who doesn't have access to yield analytics, the recipient can't receive a URL Link to access the report.
    - If you're sending a Data Snapshot, it includes the first 20-25 lines of the report in the email.
1. Click **Send**.

To schedule a report to run bi-monthly, create two monthly instances of recurrence (for example, one on the 1st and one on the 15th).

If you have administrative access, you can select **Admin Tools** > **View Reports** to view and edit scheduled reports.
