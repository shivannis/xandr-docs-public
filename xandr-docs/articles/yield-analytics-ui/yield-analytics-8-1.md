# Yield Analytics 8.1

## Feature enhancements

**Best Practices Folder** - There is a new folder of saved reports available to all publishers. The descriptions of the reports can all be found by going to Help \> Reports \> Top Reports in your help files.

**Improve Xandr Integration** - The Xandr Channel integration has added size, country, deal id/deal name, publisher name, site name, and placement name fields.

## Fixes

**New availability lookups fixes**

- Vary by without targeting - Allows you to vary by without defining targeting first.
- Move the viewability column - In the lookup results page the viewability column has moved to be next to Availability and Capacity.

**Delete saved reports** - Allows you to delete reports that had previously been saved.
