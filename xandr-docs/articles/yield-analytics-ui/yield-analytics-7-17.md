# Yield Analytics 7.17

## Feature enhancements

We have created an option to "Update All" datasets, when there are multiple datasets in reports. This will eliminate the need to go into each dataset to change a single metric filter.

1. Single dataset
    1. Normal operation
    1. \*Update All\* not visible
1. Add dataset
    1. \*Update All\* immediately visible
    1. This should be a clone of the current dataset
1. Click \*Update All\* (each filter type)
    1. Initial dataset
        1. Standard date range should be set on other DS's
    1. Subsequent/cloned dataset
        1. Custom date range should be set on other DS's (including initial)
1. Click \*Update\* (each filter type, w/multi datasets)
    1. Filter should update on the current dataset only.
1. Open saved report
    1. Single dataset
        1. \*Update All\* should not be visible
    1. Multi dataset
        1. \*Update All\* should be visible
        1. Within Find Products the metadata model now allows you to link directly to Target Visibility.There is also a horizontal scroll bar to allow you to better access the data.

## Fixes

- Corrected discrepancies between what we are showing in analyze overlaps vs. what is shown in availability look up - when running overlaps between attribute values.
- Fixed session persistence issues within Saved Lookup Edit.
