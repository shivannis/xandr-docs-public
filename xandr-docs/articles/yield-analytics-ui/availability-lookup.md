# Availability lookup

> [!TIP]
> The old Check Availability screen will still be active for a short period of time. If you prefer to continue to use the old screen, the click path to access it is: **Availability > Check Availability**. The new and old screens will work in unison during this transition time period.

The Availability Lookup screen is accessed by the following click path: **Availability > Availability Lookup
(Beta)**.

A Quick Start Guide is available, to help you quickly navigate the system.

Availability Lookup consists of four main screens:

- [Lookup Builder](lookup-builder.md)
- [Lookup Results](lookup-results.md)
- [Batch Builder](batch-builder.md)
- [Batch Queue](batch-queue.md)
