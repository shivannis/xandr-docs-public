# Member data sharing service (audience only)

## Member data sharing service (For audience data providers only)

> [!TIP]
> In order to make the Member Data Sharing documentation clearer, we've created this page which has calls relevant only to audience data providers (those that do not have a bidder/real-time integration).

The Member Data Sharing Service allows you to share your segments with
other platform members. Here's how it works:

1. You ask the buyer to enable you (the data provider) in Invest DSP.
    The setting they must use to do this is located in the Invest DSP
    **Segment Manager**, under
    **Manage Data Providers**.
1. You create a sharing record for a member that you want to share
    segments with.
1. In the sharing record, you specify whether you want to share all of
    your segments or a specific list of segments.
1. The member that you've shared your segments with can then target
    your segments in campaigns (or in the case of bidders, they will be
    sent the segment data with each bid request).

Note that when you remove a segment from a sharing record, the member
cannot add the segment to the targeting profile of any new or existing
campaign. If the member is already targeting the segment in an existing
campaign, however, the campaign will continue to target the segment
until the member manually removes it from the campaign's targeting
profile. Once the segment has been removed, the member will not be able
to add it to the campaign's targeting profile again.

> [!TIP]
> If you have custom segments intended for specific members, you should set `segment_exposure` to "list" in each sharing record and use the `segments` array to identify the segments that each member should have access to.

> [!NOTE]
> The Member Data Sharing service works on BOTH Xandr's API (api.appnexus.com) as well as the impression bus API (api.adnxs.com). Although only api.adnxs.com is used below, it may be replaced with api.appnexus.com for those clients who have access to Xandr's API. Only members who are on Xandr will have access to the API. The majority of data providers can only access the impression bus API.

## REST API

| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| DELETE | [https://api.adnxs.com/member-data-sharing?id=RECORD_ID](https://api.adnxs.com/member-data-sharing/RECORD_ID)<br>[https://api.adnxs.com/member-data-sharing/RECORD_ID](https://api.adnxs.com/member-data-sharing/RECORD_ID) | Delete a sharing record |

> [!TIP]
> JSON Structure:
>
> When adding or updating a single sharing record, you should structure the JSON as a single object called "member_data_sharing". When adding (POST) multiple sharing records, you should structure the JSON as an array of objects called "member_data_sharings" (note the plural) and place the sharing data in an array. You cannot update (PUT) multiple sharing records at the same time. For exact formatting, see the [examples](#examples) below.

## JSON Fields

| Field | Type (Length) | Description |
|---|---|---|
| buyer_member_id | int | The ID of the member with whom you are sharing segments.<br>**Required On**: POST |
| data_member_id | int |**Read-only**. Your member ID. |
| id | int | The ID of the sharing record.<br>**Default**: Auto-generated number<br>**Required On**: PUT/DELETE, in query string |
| segment_exposure | enum | Whether you share all of your segments or a list of specific segments with the member. Possible values: "all" or "list".  If you choose "all", any newly created segments will automatically be shared with the buyer member. If you create custom segments that should only be accessible to certain buyers, you should use "list" exposure.<br>**Required On**: POST |
| segments | array of objects | If segment_exposure is "list", the list of segments that you are sharing with the member. See the first example below for formatting.<br>**Required On**: POST/PUT, if segment_exposure is "list". |
