# Data marketplace overview

Buyers on the Xandr platform often use third-party data made available by our data providers to target particular audience or inventory in their campaigns. Xandr supports the clearing of fees and charges associated with the purchase of third-party data so that you can avoid having to invoice individual buyers for these changes. Instead, Xandr can directly invoice these buyers for those fees on your behalf.

> [!NOTE]
> Only data providers who have executed the Xandr Data Provider agreement with Xandr and have provided pricing are eligible to have the fees cleared by Xandr.

## Participation

1. Sign the Xandr Data Provider agreement. To obtain a copy of this contract, please contact your account representative.
1. If you are a new data provider, integrate with Xandr as an [audience data provider](audience-data-integrations.md) or as a real time data provider.
1. Create the segments that you want to make available to buyers. For details, see [Creating and Managing Segments](creating-and-managing-segments.md).
1. Create a rate card using the [taxonomy template](https://download.microsoft.com/download/a/5/1/a513362a-9ce9-486e-909b-90be51649dbd/taxonomy-template-new-7-19.xlsx)  consistent with the terms of the Xandr Data Provider agreement. Once completed, email it to your Xandr point of contact.
1. Once your completed taxonomy template is received by the Xandr Data Marketplace team, someone from that team will assist you in setting pricing for your segments.
