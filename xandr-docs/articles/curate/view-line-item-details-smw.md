# Microsoft Curate - View line item details

The Line Items Details window lets you view and edit line item settings
and access troubleshooting tools, essential metrics, performance
visualizations, and associated line item objects.

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Advertising Curate Monitoring feature is in **Open Beta** and currently only supports deal line items. It is subject to change without notice and is only available to select clients.

## Access line item details

From the **Line Items** window:

1. Select the appropriate progress tab
    (**Upcoming**,
    **In Progress**, or
    **Completed**). See [Monitor Line Items](monitor-line-items.md)
    for more information.
1. Click anywhere in the row of the line item you want to see details
    on.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can use the **Search** field at the top of the **Line Items** window to search for a specific line item or navigate from page to page using the pagination functionality at the bottom of the window. See [Monitor Line Items](monitor-line-items.md) for more information.

## Selected line item details

The advertiser (**ADV**) and insertion
order (**IO**) associated with the
selected line item, the line item name, ID, and status
(**Active** or
**Inactive**) appear at the top of the
Line Item Details window above the
**Settings** and
**Troubleshooting** tabs. You can change
the line item status by clicking the
**Active** or
**Inactive** icon. The line item
information is read-only, but you can edit the information by clicking

Items Details window.

clicking any available object to navigate to the details page for that
