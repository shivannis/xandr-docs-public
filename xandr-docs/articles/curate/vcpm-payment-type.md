#  Microsoft Curate - vCPM payment type

Viewable CPM (vCPM) is a payment type that allows buyers to pay only for
impressions that are measured "viewable" (read our [Introduction to Viewability](introduction-to-viewability.md)
for more information on viewability measurement). vCPM
is similar to CPC and CPA payment types in that the impression does not
incur a cost until a post-auction event occurs. For vCPM, the
post-auction event is a signal that the impression was viewable. Once
that event is received, the buyer will pay the full value of the vCPM
bid.

## Buying inventory on a vCPM basis

To use the vCPM payment type, select **Viewable
CPM** as your revenue type and enter your bid price.

The **vCPM** payment type supports the ability to use a custom
definition for viewable impressions. We currently support two
definitions, the IAB standard and the Group M standard. The IAB standard
definition is used by default. If you would like to use a custom
definition, contact your Microsoft Advertising Account Manager.

## vCPM payment bid calculations

Buyers submit bids at a vCPM rate, just as they would with CPC or CPA.
In order for that bid to participate in an RTB auction, the bid must be
converted into an eCPM to compete with other CPM bids.
Microsoft Advertising calculates the eCPM by multiplying the
vCPM bid amount by the estimated view rate for that impression.

> [!NOTE]
> vCPM calculations are only used to manage auction mechanics for the seller. It does not impact the buyer's final media cost or the fact that they pay only for viewable impressions.

## Example

1. vCPM bid won the auction because its eCPM was higher than the CPM
    bid. Additionally, the impression was viewed, therefore the
    advertiser pays the publisher the full $10 vCPM bid amount.
1. vCPM bid won the auction because the eCPM was still higher than the
    CPM bid of $4.00. However, there was no payout because the
    impression was not viewed.
1. The CPM bid won the bid. The 20% estimated view rate translates to
    an eCPM for Bid 1 that is lower than the CPM bid.

## Reporting on payment types

**Payment Type** is an available **Filter** and **Dimension** in
analytics reporting.

To generate a report for all vCPM buying activity, click
**Edit** on the **Payment Type** filter
and select the **vCPM** option.

Alternatively, to generate a report broken down by Payment Type, select
the **Payment Type** checkbox in the
**Dimension** column.

> [!NOTE]
> The vCPM Payment Type is only available when reporting on buying activity. For selling activity, use the **Revenue Type** option.
