# Microsoft Curate - Viewing your object limits

Microsoft Advertising limits the number of object (line items,
creatives, etc.) that you can have on the platform. The Object Limits
Report allows you to view these limits and proactively monitor your
current usage.

Both active and inactive objects are counted against the object limit.
For creatives, only non-expired objects are counted against the limit. A
creative expires when it has neither served nor been modified in 45
days.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Automatic archiving of objects:**
> Objects that have not served or been edited in more than 180 days and that are not scheduled to serve in the future are automatically archived. If an object is in the "archived" state, it cannot spend or be edited. However, it can still be copied, deleted or used in reports (or exported for use in an external reporting tool). In addition, once an object is archived, any child objects it may own (e.g., Insertion Order \> Line Item) will also be archived and no additional child objects can be created beneath the archived parent object.

## Getting to the object limits report

Your object limits report is available under your
Member Settings.

## Object limits report

The **Object Limits Report** section lists
the types of objects that are limited and provides the following data
for each:

- **Usage/Used** - The current number of active and inactive objects.
  For creatives, this does not include expired objects.
- **Limit/Available** - The maximum number of objects that you are
  allowed.
- **% Limit** -The percent of your limit that you have reached. For
  creatives, this does not include expired objects.
- **% Active** - Out of the total number of objects in use, the percent
  that are active.
- **% Served or Modified in the Last 90 Days** - The percent of objects
  that have had impressions, or have been modified, in the last 90 days.
  For creatives, since expired creatives are not counted, this will
  always be 100%. If the percentage is low, the client has many objects
  that are candidates for deletion.

> [!TIP]
> Line items that have not served or been modified in the last 90 days are good candidates for deletion. Contact your Microsoft Advertising representative if you need assistance in cleaning out old objects or to request that your object limit be increased.

## FAQs

***How will I know that I am approaching my limit for an object?***

We send you an email notification when you reach 85%, 95%, and 100% of
your limit for an object. You can change the email addresses that
receive notifications via your Member Settings.

***What if I reach my limit for an object?***

When you approach or reach your limit for any object other than
creatives, you should delete any inactive, unused, or unnecessary
instances. These deleted objects will continue to appear in reporting
but cannot be undeleted.

When you approach or reach your limit for creatives, you should remove
non-expired creatives. Non-expired creatives have the `is_expired` field
set to `false`. Note that removing expired creatives will not impact
your creative count.

***What if I am already over my limit?***

If you need to create additional objects but have already met or
exceeded your limit as listed above, please delete unused objects.

***Can my limit be raised?***

In exceptional cases, a limit may be temporarily lifted by a small
amount at the discretion of our engineering team. Please contact your
Microsoft Advertising representative to discuss this option.
