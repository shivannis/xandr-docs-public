# Microsoft Curate - Troubleshooting reports

**Troubleshooting Reports** provides you easy access to set up and run reports that can help you troubleshoot deal line items. These reports are simplified versions of the most common reports available. You can use these reports to further investigate any issues surfaced in the **Impression Funnel** section. For more information, see [Impression Funnel](curate-impression-funnel.md).

You can configure the following for each report you run:

- **Report Type** - Use the drop-down to select the report you want to run. The following reports are available:
  - **Bid Error Report**
  - **Deal Metrics Report**
- **Buyer** - The deal buyers you’d like to filter the report by. Click the **Edit** icon to change deal buyers.
- **Time Range** - Use the drop-down to select the time frame for the report. Choose from:
  - **10 Minutes**
  - **1 Hour**
  - **24 Hours**
- **Columns** - You can choose the dimensions and metrics you want in your report. To select or unselect dimensions and metrics:
  - Click **Modify Columns** to display the **Modify Columns** dialog.
  - Select the **Dimensions** or **Metrics** tab to list available columns in each.
  - Check any columns you want to add and uncheck any columns you want to remove.
  - Optionally, you can rearrange the columns by dragging and dropping them.
  - Click **Save**.
- **Run Report** - Click **Run Report** to run the report and display the results.
- **Export to CSV** - When results are displayed, you can click **Export to CSV** to download the report as a .csv file.

There are couple of additional settings are available when you run a deal metrics report. They are as follows:

- **Breakout Deals By** – You can breakout the metrics per DSP, buyer member, buyer seat, seller deal or split to get a more granular view
  of the activity occurring through your curated deal. For example, if you have issued your curated deal to multiple buyer seats, you can see the number of bids per seat; or if you target seller deals you can see the number of imps matched per seller deal.
- **Time Range** – How far back you would like to include data. For example, last 24 hours.
- **Time Interval** – How you would like to group the data. For example, by hour.
