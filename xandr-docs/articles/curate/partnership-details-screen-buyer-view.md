# Microsoft Curate - Partnership details screen - Buyer view

On the Partnership details screen you can review and manage your relationship with a specific seller. You can track overall spend trends,
view your top brands on the seller's inventory, view the seller's top - publishers from whom you have purchased inventory, view active and
pending deals, and communicate with the seller to negotiate a deal.

## Getting to the partnership details screen

1. Navigate to the **Partner Center** screen by selecting **Admin > Partner Center**.
1. Select a partner's name to access the details specific to that partner.
   You can manage your relationship with a specific seller by reviewing spending trends, packages, and active and upcoming deals.

## Viewing seller contact Info and description

Click on a seller and click **Show Profile** to view profile information the seller has provided, including the main contact's name, phone number, email address, and a description of their business. You can contact the seller directly by sending a message within the **Activity Stream**. For more information about the **Activity Stream**, see [Communicating with the Seller](partnership-details-screen-buyer-view.md#communicating-with-the-seller).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the seller has not entered their contact's name, phone number, email address, or a description of their business, then this information will not be available.

## Viewing your performance on the seller's inventory

Click on a seller to view statistics about how your ad campaigns are performing on the seller's inventory. These statistics update every 24 hours.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not purchased any inventory from the seller, there will be no information to display in the dashboard.

## Spend

A graph displays spend from all transactions between you and the seller within the last 30 days. You can use this graph to monitor your activity on the seller's inventory. If you are targeting an active deal, this graph can help give you insight into the deal's effectiveness. Since the spend displayed here reflects all transactions, this graph will not help you keep track of the spend from a specific deal.

There is a data point for every day. Hover over a data point to see the date it represents and the spend amount for that day.

### Spend by top publishers

A table lists the seller's top publishers from whom you have purchased inventory, listed in order from most to least spend. This information tells you which of the seller's publishers you are performing best on.

## Communicating with the seller

In the **Activity Stream**, the Messages tab shows messages between you and the seller along with the number of days since the message was posted. You can use the **Activity Stream** to introduce yourself to a new seller, request changes to your eligibility, allowed payment types, and targeting access, or discuss why your targeting access isn't working for you.

In this section you can:

- **Send a message:** Send the seller a message by typing into the field at the top of the section, and then clicking
  Post. When you post a new message, the system sends a notification to the contact in the seller's  profile.
- **View last update information:** Text at the top of the section will note when the **Activity Stream** was last updated.
- **Hide Activity Stream:** Click the Hide Activity Stream icon ("**<**") to collapse the section and provide more working space.

Click on the **Notifications** tab in the **Activity Stream** to view system messages.

## View your settings for the seller

The seller eligibility and inventory trust settings display in the **My Settings for {Seller Name}** section.

## View the seller's settings for you

The eligibility (**My Eligibility**), **Allowed Payment Types**, and **Targeting Access** settings the seller has set for you display in the **{Seller Name} Settings for Me** section. The **Targeting Access** settings show you what the seller has exposed or hidden
and include the following:

- **URLs** - If domains are exposed, you can more easily target the seller's inventory using allowlists.
- **Categories(Universal)** or **Categories(Custom)** - If Universal or Custom Categories are exposed, you can more easily target via
  categories.
- **Age or Gender** - If age or gender information is exposed, you can target via those demographics.
- **Placements or Publishers** - If placements or publishers are exposed, you can more easily directly target a placement or publisher. For more information on targeting specific placements or publishers, see [Direct Inventory Targeting)](../monetize/direct-inventory-targeting.md).

## Editing partner settings

Click **Edit** in the **My Settings for {Seller Name}** section to manage the inventory trust settings you have set for the seller.

## Viewing deals

**Deals** displays the number of deals available to you from the seller. Click the number to display current
and past deals from the seller. Each deal displays with additional details, see [Manage Your Deals with Sellers](manage-your-deals-with-sellers.md) for more information.

## Edit a deal

If you would like to make changes to a deal, send the seller a message to discuss your needs (see [Communicating with the Seller](partnership-details-screen-buyer-view.md#communicating-with-the-seller)). The seller can then edit the deal.

## Reporting on deals

You can run a report to see how your deals are performing. See [Buy Side Reporting On-Deals](../monetize/buy-side-reporting-on-deals.md) for more information.

## Viewing packages

**Packages** display the number of packages available to you. Sellers package their inventory to provide special access to their premium inventory, discounted rates, or other opportunities. Click the number under **Packages** to review each package's description, price, and sizes in the **Package Marketplace** to determine if you are interested. Then, add the packages you are interested in to your cart to generate deals. For more information on generating a deal from a package, see [Get Deals From Seller Packages](../monetize/get-deals-from-seller-packages.md).

## Requesting a custom deal

If you see a package in the **Package Marketplace** that interests you but needs some modification, you can send the seller a message with your request. Click **Request a Custom Deal**, explain your need, and then click **Submit** to post your message in the **Activity Stream** on the **Partner Details** page (). Use the **Activity Stream** to continue your negotiation with the seller. If the seller agrees to the change you requested, you will need to generate a deal from a package (see below). The seller will then modify your deal to meet your needs.

## Generating a deal from a package

If you are interested in the packaged inventory, you can generate deals between you and the seller. Click **Add to Cart** near the desired packages, then click **Get Deals** to create deals that you can target.

## Targeting a deal from the packages tab

If you generated a deal from a package, your deal ID is displayed in the **Selected Packages** section, see [Get Deals from Seller Packages](../monetize/get-deals-from-seller-packages.md) for more information.
