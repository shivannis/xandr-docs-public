# Microsoft Curate - Inventory lists

## Introduction

Inventory lists are a way to group the domains, apps, and app bundle IDs
that you want to target or exclude on your insertion orders and line
items. Each inventory list must be either an allowlist (for restricting
targeting) or blocklist (for excluding) and can contain any combination
of domains, apps, or app bundle IDs. Examples of items that may be
included in your inventory lists are:

- app bundle IDs:
  - 617263396
  - com.magmamobile.game.Elements
- raw URL (domain):
  [yahoo.com](https://sg.yahoo.com/?p=us&guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLnhhbmRyLmNvbS9idW5kbGUvY3VyYXRlX2N1cmF0ZS1zdGFuZGFyZC9wYWdlL3RvcGljcy9pbnZlbnRvcnktbGlzdHMtYWxpLW9ubHkuaHRtbA&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMSoXxyw3IEmTV0V-VHeMJVlfGxL_SiW9qW1TXmUnxbXG-dIQlBveckoB3VFQsJYErKnqj0y0ZyGh86t-ZlmJyLBvHAOLi2-irA1ujjG0yk1Ozc_psHpUpLrV1FU4TZqTeWGamHONbF1Z-EuWrgQt9rALpQPk9kGkC61tvEhJk0K)
- raw URL (app): [ https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/funny-pics-lol!-daily-laughs/id617263396](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/funny-laughs-lol-pics-jokes/id617263396)

Inventory Lists can be applied via the
**Allowlist** or
**Blocklist** fields within the
**Inventory & Brand Safety** section for
line items and **Supply Strategy** section
for insertion orders.

## Domains

- You can target domains (`test4.com`) and subdomains
  (`review.test4.com`), but you can't target specific directories within
  domains (`test4.com/review`) by default. For example, targeting
  `test4.com/review` is not supported as a standard practice in the
  system. However, such directories can be targetted on a case by case
  basis as exceptions.
- The process of targeting of domains (`test4.com`) and subdomains
  (`review.test4.com`) depends on whether the subdomains are mapped or
  not. A subdomain is mapped if it has an ID associated with it. In that
  case, the subdomain can be allowed or blocked within a list
  independent of the top-level domain.
- Alternatively, if a subdomain is unmapped or defined as unsupported,
  the top-level domain must be included in a list and a checkbox
  **Include subdomains** needs to be
  selected to target the subdomains under it. This option of
  **Include subdomains** checkbox is given
  under each top-level domain for this purpose.
  
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > The **Include subdomains** checkbox will only appear if a domain is broken out for subdomain audit in the system. If a domain is not broken out, the checkbox will not appear and all subdomains under the targetted top-level domain will be included for targeting automatically.

- Domains that begin with `www` will have the `www` substring stripped
  out before being stored in our system. For example, `www.example.org`
  will be shortened to `example.org`.

## Apps

**App Bundle ID (App ID)**

An app bundle ID (or app ID) is just a unique identifier for a specific
app. App IDs are defined differently depending on whether the app runs
on iOS or Android:

- Every iOS app has a unique iTunes ID
- Every Android app has a unique Android Package Name

**How to find App IDs**

To find the IDs for an Android or IOS app, find the app's detail page -
the easiest way is to do a web search. The URL of the app store's detail
page will show the app's ID.

For example, here are the detail pages for the "Candy Crush" app:

- Google Play: [ https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.king.candycrushsaga](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.king.candycrushsaga)
  - ID: com.king.candycrushsaga
- iTunes: [https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id553834731](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/candy-crush-saga/id553834731)
  - ID: 553834731

**How to choose which apps to target**

To identify specific mobile apps to target, we recommend targeting the
region you're interested in, activating your campaign, and after a few
days running the [site-domain-performance](../invest/site-domain-performance.md) report, which will show
you the apps that you've been reaching. You can then update your
targeting to include or exclude specific apps to meet your needs.

## Key to Domain/App audit flags

Each domain or app in a list can have one of the following audit
statuses:

- :::image type="content" source="media/audit-check.png" alt-text="Screenshot of audit check ."::: - the domain/app has been audited and approved.
- **Rejected** : The reason the domain/app has been rejected after being
  audited (e.g., Hate Speech).
- "**--**" - the domain/app is either unauditable (has been reviewed but
  can't be audited) or is pending audit (has not been reviewed yet, but
  is in the audit queue).
- **Masked** - the seller is not exposing the domain/app's actual URL
  for targeting or reporting. However, the real domain/app URL is still
  audited by Microsoft Advertising inventory quality controls
  within the bid request.
- **Unsupported** - the domain/app is not yet in the
  Microsoft Advertising audit queue. You should submit a
  Salesforce ticket to have it reviewed.

> [!NOTE]
> For audit status "`--`" or "*Unsupported*", creatives will be delivered through managed inventory or deals. They will not be delivered in open exchange unless you have allowed unauditable creatives for the line item.

> [!NOTE]
> The domains with audit status of either  :::image type="content"  source="media/audit-check.png" alt-text="Screenshot of audit check ."::: or "**--**" are available for use in the augmented line item inventory lists.

## Create a new inventory list

1. Go to the **Inventory Lists** screen.
    Select **Inventory \>
    Inventory Lists**.
1. Click **New**. The
    **Create List** window displays.
1. Enter a name for the inventory list.
1. Click **Add list description** to add
    a description if necessary.
1. Select the **List Type**:
    - **Allowlist** (for restriction)
    - **Blocklist** (for exclusion)
1. Specify whether this inventory list will be
    **Available to**:
    - **Any Advertiser** - the inventory
      list will be available for selection on the insertion orders and
      line items of any advertiser. If you select the
      **Require for all Line Items**
      checkbox, the inventory list will be applied to **all** existing
      and new line items under all of your advertisers and can't be
      removed from each individual line item. However, you can clear the
      checkbox if you want to undo this for all existing and new line
      items.

      > [!NOTE]
      > The inventory lists that are set to **Required for all** will only be applied to third-party inventory.
      
    - **Specific Advertiser** - the
      inventory list will only be available for selection on the
      insertion orders and line items of a specific advertiser (select a
      specific advertiser in the **Select one** drop-down).
1. Click **Next**.
1. Click either:
    - **Copy and paste domains & apps** to
      enter or paste a list of domains and/or apps to be included in
      this inventory list.
    - **Import from file** to import a
      list of domains and/or apps to be included in this inventory list.

      > [!NOTE]
      >  The maximum number of domains and/or apps per inventory list is limited to 100,000.

1. Click **Validate Domains & Apps**. The
    list will be checked to ensure that:
    - None of the domains or apps you entered violate
      Microsoft Advertising policies.
    - Unsupported URLs are flagged. Unsupported means the
      Microsoft Advertising targeting system hasn't audited
      these URLs yet so that you won't be able to serve on them.
    - Invalid URL formats (i.e., non-http or non-https) are removed from
      the list.
1. Click **Next**. The domains and apps
    you entered will be listed along with
    **Flags** for each ( see [Key to Domain/App Audit Flags](#key-to-domainapp-audit-flags) for more
    information). If the list is large, use the arrows to advance
    through the pages. Note the following:
    - Unsupported domains or apps will be flagged.
    - You can also remove any domains or apps that violate
      Microsoft Advertising policies by clicking
      **Remove**. However, you will never
      serve on them even if you leave them in the list.
    - Select **Include subdomains** to
      include subdomains. For example, if you selected this option for
      "mydomain.com", you would also serve on its subdomains such as
      "mydomain.com/foo" and "foo.mydomain.com".
1. Click **Create List**. The inventory
    list is created and displays in
    **Inventory Lists**.

    can select up to five lists.)
1. Select **Export List** from the
    **Actions** menu.

The list(s) you selected will be downloaded to your local drive. If you
exported:

- A single list, the file will have a `.csv` extension.
- More than one list, a file with today's date and `.zip` extension will
  be downloaded. That `.zip` file will contain a `.csv` file for each
  list that you exported.
