# Microsoft Curate - Sources of planner information

Impression estimates are based on a seven-day sample of data, defined at the daily level. Planner stores seven days' worth of samples, resulting in a rolling weekly snapshot that is updated once per day.

The following table shows the scale of historical data underlying the estimates:

|  |  |
|---|---|
| **Daily** | 10 million auctions/users from the past day |
| **Weekly** | 20 million impressions/users from the past 7 days |
