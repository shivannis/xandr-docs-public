The **Impression Funnel** panel on the **Troubleshooting** tab enables you to view the metrics of a curated deal as a whole and assess its overall
performance.

The **Impression Funnel: Seller Deals** panel contains a table that allows you to see the curated deal’s impression funnel and metrics broken out for each seller deal, it sources inventory from. The panel will appear if the curated deal's **Supply Stratergy** is configured to source inventory from seller deals.

If you frequently source inventory from seller deals, this table enables
you to effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues. For example, if your
curated deal is experiencing low delivery, you can use the table to
check a few possible causes:

- **Seller deals with the lowest imps matched**: To check if the deals
  are contributing to fewer matched imps than you would expect.
- **Seller deals with the lowest bid rates**: To check if the buyer's
  targeting is restricting the seller deals on which they bid.
- **Seller deals with the lowest win rates**: To check if an issue is
  preventing the buyer from winning impressions effectively through a
  seller deal.
