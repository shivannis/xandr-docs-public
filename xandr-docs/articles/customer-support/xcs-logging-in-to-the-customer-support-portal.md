# Logging in to the customer support portal

If you do not already have a portal account, please visit the [Login](https://help.xandr.com/) page, click Proceed as a Guest, and in the next page, click **Contact Support**. Once your account is created, you will be sent a welcome email with your user ID and temporary password to log in. You can set your own password following the link in the welcome mail.

> [!NOTE]
> Continuing as a guest without logging in, gives you limited access to knowledge base articles. If you
> contacted support as a guest, without logging in to the portal, you will only be able to communicate via email.

Once your account is set, you can access the Customer Support Portal by going directly to the [Login](https://help.xandr.com/) page and entering your Email and Password.

> [!NOTE]
> The portal account is separate from and [Documentation Portal](https://docs.xandr.com/) accounts. You will need to log in to each system separately. Note that each account may have a different password.
