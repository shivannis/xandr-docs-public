# Email in the customer support portal

Log in to the [Customer Support Portal](https://help.xandr.com) to access your full case history, knowledge base
articles, or request support.

If you contacted support as a guest, without logging in to the portal, you will only be able to communicate via email.

If anyone you've cc'd on a case would like a portal account, they can visit the [Login](https://help.xandr.com)page, proceed as a Guest, and click **Contact Support**.
