# On Event

This function defines a callback function to execute on the given `event_type`.

``` pre
onEvent('eventType', 'targetId', function(){})
```

The parameters listed below can be sent as arguments in the function.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `eventType` | string | The event to listen for on the tag.<br>- `adRequested`: An ad was requested from the Impression Bus.<br>- `adAvailable`: A creative was returned from the Impression Bus but has not yet been shown.<br>- `adBadRequest`: The tag called a placement that doesn't exist.<br>- `adLoaded`: An ad placement has been fully defined and is ready to be shown; `apn.showTag` has been successfully executed.<br>- `adNoBid`: No bid was received for the ad tag.<br>- `adRequestFailure`: Failure to retrieve the creative. Could indicate a problem with the setup of the ad tag, or a problem contacting the endpoint.<br>- `adError`: Error caused by the creative itself (any first or third party in the chain) that was delivered by AST. Note that the ad may still be shown.<br>- `adCollapse`: Can be triggered by the creative, if the creative contains `window.parent.apntag.collapseAd(document.body.id)`. |
| `function` | function | The function to execute when the event is triggered. Some events will allow you to include parameters in the function to receive additional information within the function. See [Ad Object API](ad-object-api.md) for details. |
| `targetId` | string | The unique identifier of a specific ad slot. Omitting this parameter will execute callback function for all the tags defined on the page for defined eventType. This is an optional parameter. |

## Example

``` pre
apntag.onEvent('adError', 'apn_ad_slot_1', function(adError, adObj){
        console.log('callback executed');
        console.log(adObj);
        console.log(adError);
});
 
apntag.onEvent('adError', function(adError, adObj){
        console.log('callback executed');
        console.log(adObj);
        console.log(adError);
});
```
