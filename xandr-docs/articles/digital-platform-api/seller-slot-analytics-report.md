# Seller slot analytics report

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality currently is in **Alpha**. It is still under development and may be subject to change without notice. Contact your Xandr Account Representative to get it enabled.

The **Seller Slot Analytics report** shows metrics for impressions (slots) within groups of ads (pods) delivered sequentially in between segments of non-commercial video programming.

You can use this report to gain insight in answering the following questions:

- On average how many seconds per impression are being served for mid-roll slot positions 1, 2 and 3?
- How does the CPM of the first slot within a pre-roll compare to the first slot within a mid-roll?
- How many seconds has a brand served in pre-rolls compared to mid-rolls?
- Which slot positions is a line item delivering in?
- What is the percentage of slots by position being consumed by my house line item?
- Which cities did a line item deliver to?
- How does the completion rate by video context and slot position compare?

## Time frame

The `report_interva`l field in the JSON request can be set to one of the following:

- custom

   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"09b6979a6a4c3805bdac8921378d3622"
   }
}
```

### Retrieve the status of the report

Make a `GET` call with the report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=09b6979a6a4c3805bdac8921378d3622'
 
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report":{
         "name":null,
         "created_on":"2023-02-03 20:09",
         "json_request": "{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"seller_slot_video_report_network\",
             \"columns\":[\"day\",\"seller_member_id\",
             \"call_type\",\"url\",\"ad_requests_gdpr_country\",\"ad_requests_gdpr_applied_valid_consent_string\",\"ad_requests_gdpr_applied_blank_consent_string\",
             \"ad_requests_gdpr_applied_valid_consent_string_tcf_version_2\",\"pct_ad_requests_gdpr_country_gdpr_applied\",
             \"pct_ad_requests_gdpr_applied_valid_consent_string\",\"pct_ad_requests_gdpr_applied_blank_consent_string\",
             \"pct_ad_requests_gdpr_applied_valid_consent_string_tcf_version_2\"],
             \"report_interval\":\"last_7_days\",\"format\":\"csv\",\"filters\":[{\"seller_member_id\":\"123\"}]}}",
             "url":"report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592"
      },
      "execution_status":"ready"
   }
}
```

### Download the report

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and report ID in the `url` field of the response to your previous `GET` call. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the file format that you specified in your initial `POST`.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592' > /tmp/seller_slot_video_report_network.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.
> - There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
