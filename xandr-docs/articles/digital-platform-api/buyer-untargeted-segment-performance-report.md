## Examples

### Step 1: Create the JSON report request

The JSON file should include the following:

- `"report_type"` you want to run.
- `"columns"` (dimensions and metrics) you want to retrieve.
- `"report_interval"` you want to retrieve.

You can also include `filters` for dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the `format` in which the data
should be returned (`"csv"`, `"excel"`, or `"html"`).

> [!NOTE]
> To filter a dimension by more than one value, use an array. For example:
>
> **Correct:**
>
> `"filters": [{"bid_type": ["learn","optimized"]}, {"geo_country":"US"}]`
>
> **Incorrect:**
>
> `"filters": [{"bid_type":"learn"}, {"bid_type":"optimized"}, {"geo_country":"US"}]`

For more details about the columns that can be included in the request, see [Dimensions](#dimensions) and [Metrics](#metrics) above.

The example below demonstrates how to retrieve the Buyer Untargeted Segment Performance Report. In this example, the report will display
data for the `hour`, `campaign_id`, `imps`, `clicks`, `total_convs`, `ctr`, and `convs_rate` columns. This report will pull data from the
last 48 hours and will format it as a CSV file.

```
$ cat report_request
{
        "report":{
                "report_type":"buyer_untargeted_segment_performance",
                "columns":[
                        "hour",
                        "campaign_id",
                        "imps",
                        "clicks",
                        "total_convs",
                        "ctr",
                        "convs_rate"
                ],
                "report_interval":"last_48_hours",
                "format":"csv"
        }
}
```

### Step 2: `POST` the request to the Report Service

`POST` the JSON request to get back a `report_ID`.

```
$ curl -b cookies -X post -d @report_request "https://api.appnexus.com/report"
 
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"09b6979a6a4c3805bdac8921378d3622"
   }
}
```

Alternatively, you can get a `report_id` via a `POST` request using a `saved_report_id`.

```
curl -b cookies -X POST 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?saved_report_id=30'
```

### Step 3: `GET` the report status from the Report Service

Make a `GET` call with the `report_id` to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then, use the `report-download` service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=09b6979a6a4c3805bdac8921378d3622'
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report":{
         "name":null,
         "created_on":"2010-05-25 19:15:48",
         "json_request":"{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"network_advertiser_frequency\",\"columns\":
          [\"hour\",\"campaign\",\"imps\",\"clicks\",\"total_convs\",
          \"ctr\",\"convs_rate\"],\"row_per\":[\"hour\",\"campaign_id\"],
          \"report_interval\":\"last_48_hours\",\"filters\":[{\"advertiser_id\":\"690\"}]}}",
         "url":"report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592"
      },
      "execution_status":"ready"
   }
}
```

### Step 4: `GET` the report data from the Report Download Service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the report ID, but this time to the `report-download` service. You can find the service and report ID in the `"url"` field of the response to your previous `GET` call. When setting the file to which you want to save the report, use the file extension of the `"format"` (e.g., .csv) that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!NOTE]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `\-i` or `\-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592' -o /tmp/network_advertiser_frequency.csv
```
