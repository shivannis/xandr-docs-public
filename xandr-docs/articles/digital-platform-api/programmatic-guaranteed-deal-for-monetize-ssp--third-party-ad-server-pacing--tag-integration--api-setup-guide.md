# Programmatic Guaranteed deal with third-party ad server

Setting up an API implementation for a programmatic guaranteed (PG) deal with third-party ad server pacing and tag integration requires
configuring a number of different properties on different API objects. This guide will explain the process of creating and configuring a PG deal using our API.

## Overview

PG deals are a powerful feature that allow network and publisher clients to better support their buyers by providing prepackaged, user-friendly buying tools for fixed-price deals.

Setting up a PG deal involves making requests to the following API service endpoints to access or create the corresponding API objects:

| API Endpoint | API Object | Detailed Reference |
|:---|:---|:---|
| [https://api.appnexus.com/advertiser](https://api.appnexus.com/advertiser) | advertiser | [Advertiser Service](advertiser-service.md) |
| [https://api.appnexus.com/insertion-order](https://api.appnexus.com/insertion-order) | insertion-order | [Insertion Order Service](insertion-order-service.md) |
| [https://api.appnexus.com/deal](https://api.appnexus.com/deal) | deal | [Deal Service](deal-service.md) |
| [https://api.appnexus.com/profile](https://api.appnexus.com/profile) | profile | [Profile Service](profile-service.md) |
| [https://api.appnexus.com/line-item](https://api.appnexus.com/line-item) | line-item (ALI) | [Line Item - ALI Service](line-item-service---ali.md) |

This guide uses cURL examples for all requests. You can use other API request tools (e.g., [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)), but you’ll then need to adjust the examples accordingly.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this setup, be sure to read [API Getting Started](api-getting-started.md). It provides information on testing environments, usage constraints, API semantics (running commands, filtering, sorting, etc.), and best practices.

## Order of operations

API objects often have dependencies on other API objects and there is an order you must follow in creating or accessing objects when you create a PG deal. For example, you must provide the IDs of the following API objects: `advertiser`, `insertion-order`, `deal`, and `profile`. To obtain the IDs for these objects, you'll need to either create them or already have access to them. The steps in this guide follow the typical order of operations required to create a PG deal.

## Best practices

For a general list of best practices to follow when working with the API, see [API Best Practices](api-best-practices.md). The following are some best practices that are specific to a deal line item setup:

- Set the `state` field of the deal line item to `"inactive"` until the line item is fully configured and ready for testing.
- Note the ID of any objects you create. The IDs of objects you create are returned in the response body of requests. You'll often need these IDs later so copying them when they're returned can reduce the number of additional `GET` requests you have to make to obtain them.

## Setup procedure

The following steps will guide you through the process of setting up a deal line item with typical configurations:

- [Step 1 - Obtain an authorization token](#step-1-obtain-an-authorization-token)
- [Step 2 - Create or access an advertiser](#step-2-create-or-access-an-advertiser)
- [Step 3 - Create or access an insertion order for PG](#step-3-create-or-access-an-insertion-order-for-pg)
- [Step 4 - Create a PG deal](#step-4-create-a-pg-deal)
- [Step 5 - Create a PG deal line item profile](#step-5-create-a-deal-line-item-profile)
- [Step 6 - Create a PG deal line item](#step-6-create-a-pg-deal-line-item)

### Step 1: Obtain an authorization token

First, you’ll need to obtain an authorization token. You must then include this authorization token in all subsequent requests. For more information, see [Authentication Service](authentication-service.md). To obtain an authorization token, do the following:

1. Create a JSON file containing your username and password.

    ```
    {
        "auth": {
            "username" : "USERNAME",
            "password" : "PASSWORD"
        }
    }
    ```

1. Make a `POST` request to the `/auth` endpoint with this JSON file in the request body. For more information, see [Authentication Service](authentication-service.md). In the cURL request below, the authorization token returned is stored in the “`cookies`” file.

    ```
    curl -c cookies -X POST -d @authentication.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/auth'
    ```

1. Check the response body of your request (see **Example Response** below). If your request was successful, you’ll get a "`status`" of “`OK`” and the "`token`" field will be populated with the authentication token value.  
    **Example Response**

    ```
    {
       "response" : {
          "token" : "authn:225692:2d787d1838283:lax1",
          "status" : "OK"      
       }
    }
    ```

### Step 2: Create or access an advertiser

You'll need to create or access an advertiser from which to create a deal line item. For deal line items, advertisers are set up the same way as augmented line items.

If you don't already have an advertiser to use, create an advertiser by doing the following (for more information, see [Advertiser Service](advertiser-service.md)):

1. Create an advertiser JSON:

    ```
    $ cat advertiser.json
    {
        "advertiser": {
            "name": "Deal Line Item Example Advertiser",
            "timezone": "US/Pacific"
        }
    }
    ```

1. Make a `POST` request to the [https://api.appnexus.com/advertiser](https://api.appnexus.com/advertiser) endpoint with this advertiser JSON and an appropriate `member_id`.

    ```
    curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @advertiser.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/advertiser?member_id=2378'
    ```

1. Check the response body of your request. If your request was successful, you’ll get a "`status`" of “`OK`” and you’ll see the updates you made.

1. Note the advertiser ID in the response body so you can use it when you create the deal line item in [Step 6 - Create a deal line item](#step-6-create-a-pg-deal-line-item).

#### JSON fields for advertiser (required and useful optional fields)

| Field | Type | Required or Optional | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `name` | string | Required | The name of the advertiser |
| `timezone` | enum | Optional | The timezone of the advertiser. For details and accepted values, see [API Timezones](api-timezones.md). |
| `use_insertion_orders` | boolean | Required | This field must be set to `true` in order to create deal line items. |

### Step 3: Create or access an insertion order for PG

You'll need to create or access an insertion order to create a PG deal. Deal line items require a seamless insertion order (see required fields below).

If you don't already have an insertion order to use, create an insertion order by doing the following (for more information, see [Insertion Order Service](insertion-order-service.md)):

1. Create an insertion order JSON (two examples are shown below):  
    **Example JSON: No end date, unlimited budget**

    ```
    $ cat insertion-order-noenddate.json
    {
        "insertion-order": {
            "name": "PG Deal Example IO",
                    "state": "active",
            "budget_intervals": [{
                "start_date": "2022-10-10 00:00:00",
                "end_date": null,
                "daily_budget": null,
                "daily_budget_imps": null,
                "enable_pacing": true,
                "lifetime_budget": null,
                "lifetime_budget_imps": null
            }],
            "budget_type": "impression"
        }
        }
    ```

1. Make a `POST` request to the [https://api.appnexus.com/insertion-order](https://api.appnexus.com/insertion-order) endpoint with this insertion order JSON and an appropriate `advertiser_id` and `member_id`.  

    **Example request: No end date, unlimited budget**

    ```
    curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @insertion-order-noenddate.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/insertion-order?advertiser_id=2605036&member_id=2378'
    ```

1. Check the response body of your request. If your request was successful, you’ll get a "`status`" of “`OK`” and you’ll see the updates you made.

1. Note the insertion order ID in the response body so you can use it when you create the PG deal line item in [Step 6 - Create a deal line item](#step-6-create-a-pg-deal-line-item).

#### JSON fields for seamless insertion order (required and useful optional fields)

| Field | Type | Required or Optional | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `name` | string | Required | The name of the insertion order |
| `state` | enum | Required | The state of the insertion order: `active` or `inactive` |
| `budget_intervals`<br>(Billing Periods) | array of objects | Required | To create an insertion order for a PG deal through the API, to be seamless, you must use the `budget_intervals` field. The following array objects must be set to to the following values:<br>- `"end_date"`: `null`<br>- `"lifetime_budget"`: `null`<br>- `"lifetime_budget_imps"`: `null`<br>- `"daily_budget"`: `null`<br>- `"daily_budget_imps"`: `null`<br>- `"enable_pacing"`: `false`<br>- `"lifetime_pacing"`: `false`<br>- `"lifetime_pacing_pct"`: `null` |
| `budget_type` | enum | Required | Budget type will translate to all deals below the insertion order. For PG deals, the `budget_type` field can be set to either of the following values: `"impression"` or `"flexible"`. If you select an impression budget type for your insertion order, then you can't have deal line items with a revenue budget associated to that insertion order. However, insertion orders with `"flexible"` budget types can have deal line items with either impression or revenue budget types. |

### Step 4: Create a PG deal

You'll need to create the deal you want to associate with the PG deal line item.

To create a deal, do the following (for more information, see [Deal Service](deal-service.md)):

1. Create a deal JSON:

    ```
    $ cat deal.json
    {
        "deal": {
            "name": "Deal Line Item Example Deal",
            "buyer": {
                "id": 2379
            },
            "version": 2
        }
    }
    ```

1. Make a `POST` request to the [https://api.appnexus.com/deal](https://api.appnexus.com/deal) endpoint with this deal JSON and an appropriate `member_id`.

    ```
    curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @deal.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/deal?member_id=2378'
    ```

1. Check the response body of your request. If your request was successful, you’ll get a "`status`" of “`OK`” and you’ll see the updates you made.

1. Note the deal ID in the response body so you can use it when you create the deal line item in [Step 6 - Create a deal line item](#step-6-create-a-pg-deal-line-item).

#### JSON fields for deal

| Field | Type | Required or Optional | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `name` | string | Required | The name of the deal. <br>(**Note:** The buyer will see this name.) |
| `active` | Boolean | Optional | The state of the insertion order: `true` or `false`. The default value for this field is `true`. |
| `buyer_members` | object | Required | Your deal buyer's name and associated code. See [example](#buyer_members-example).<br>**Note:** PG deals can only have one buyer. |
| `version` | int | Required | This field must be set to `"2"`. |
| `auction_type` | object | Required | This object's fields must be set accordingly for a PG deal:<br>- `"id":` `3`<br>- `"name":` `"Fixed Price"`<br><br>**Note:** This field must be set upon creation, but it is not used on deal line items. It will not be updated if the line item is updated and in the auction; only the line item values are considered. |
| `type` | object | Required | This object's fields must be set accordingly for a PG deal:<br>- `"id":` `4`<br>- `"name":` `"Programmatic Guaranteed"` |
| `ask_price` | double | Required | This is the price shown to the buyer. It is the minimum they must bid in order to compete for the inventory. |
| `currency` | enum | Required | The currency for the `floor_price`. For a full list of available currencies, use the read-only [Currency Service](currency-service.md). The default value for this field is `"USD"`. |
| `use_deal_floor` | Boolean | Required | This field must be set to `true`. When this field is set to `true`, the `floor_price` is applied for the deal. When `use_deal_floor` is `true`, the deal's floor price overrides any other floors you may have, for example, in placements or yield management profiles.<br><br>**Note:** As of 2017, only `ask_price` is used. API `POST` and `PUT` calls referencing `floor_price` and `use_deal_floor` will work as follows:<br>- If the API call includes `ask_price` only, this is the value that will be used.<br>- If the API call includes only a `floor_price` value, this value will be converted into the `ask_price` value. |

##### `buyer_members` example

```
"buyer_members":[
{
"name": "Microsoft Advertising Exchange",
"code": "280"
}
]

    "visibility-profile": {
        "expose_ip_default": false,
        "ip_exposure_default": "truncated",
        "name": "Deal Visibility Profile - Hidden"
    }
}
 
 
> curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @visibility_profile.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/visibility-profile?member_id=2378'
```

**Step 2: Associate the visibility profile to the deal and enable data protection**

```
> cat deal_data_protection.json
{
    "deal": {
        "visibility_profile_id": 29657,
        "data_protected": true
    }
}
 
 
> curl -b cookies -c cookies -X PUT -d @deal_data_protection.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/deal?id=549271'
```

**URL**

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `url_exposure_default` | enum | The visibility of inventory URLs in your bid requests. Possible values:<br>- `full`: Full URLs are passed in your bid requests.<br>- `domain`: Only domains of URLs are passed in your bid requests.<br>- `hidden`: URLs are not passed in your bid requests. |

**Protect domain example**

**Step 1: Create a visibility profile**

```
> cat visibility_profile.json
{
    "visibility-profile": {
        "name": "Deal Visibility Profile - Hidden",
        "url_exposure_default": "hidden"
    }
}
 
> curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @visibility_profile.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/visibility-profile?member_id=2378'
```

**Step 2: Associate the visibility profile to the deal and enable data protection**

```
> cat deal_data_protection.json
{
    "deal": {
        "visibility_profile_id": 29657,
        "data_protected": true
    }
}
 
 
> curl -b cookies -c cookies -X PUT -d @deal_data_protection.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/deal?id=549271'
```

**Add to Segment (see [Deal Service](deal-service.md))**

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `allow_creative_add_on_view` | boolean | Set `false` to disallow buyers from adding users to segments on view. |
| `allow_creative_add_on_click` | boolean | Set `false` to disallow buyers from adding users to segments on click. |

**Prevent adding to segment on click or view example**

```
> cat add_segment.json
{
    "deal": {
        "allow_creative_add_on_click": false,
        "allow_creative_add_on_view": false
    }
}
 

> curl -b cookies -c cookies -X PUT -d @add_segment.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/deal?id=123456'
```

### Step 5: Create a deal line item profile

Next, create a deal line item profile to use in targeting with the deal line item. Be sure to note the ID for this profile for later use. For more information, see [Profile Service](profile-service.md).

To create a PG deal line item profile, do the following (for more information, see [Profile Service](profile-service.md)):

1. Create a PG deal line item profile JSON:

    **Example: Profile creation with country, frequency/recency caps, and view rate/completion rate thresholds**

    ```
    $ cat profile.json
     
    {
        "profile": {
            "country_action": "include",
            "country_targets": [{
                "active": true,
                "code": "US",
                "id": 233,
                "name": "United States"
            }],
            "engagement_rate_targets": [{
                    "engagement_rate_pct": 25,
                    "engagement_rate_type": "video_completion"
                },
                {
                    "engagement_rate_pct": 50,
                    "engagement_rate_type": "predicted_iab_video_view_rate"
                }
            ],
            "max_day_imps": 10,
            "min_minutes_per_imp": 300
        }
    }
    ```

    **Example: Profile creation without targeting**

    ```
    > cat profile.json
     
    {
        "profile": {
        }
    }
    ```

1. Make a `POST` request to the [https://api.appnexus.com/profile](https://api.appnexus.com/profile) endpoint with this deal profile JSON and an appropriate `advertiser_id`.

    **Example: Profile creation with country, frequency/recency caps, and view rate/completion rate thresholds**

    ```
    > curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @profile.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/profile?advertiser_id=3410892&member_id=2378'
    ```

    **Example: Profile creation without targeting**

    ```
    > curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @profile.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/profile?advertiser_id=3410892&member_id=2378'
    ```

1. Check the response body of your request. If your request was successful, you’ll get a "`status`" of “`OK`” and you’ll see the updates you made.

1. Note the profile ID in the response body so you can use it when you create the PG deal line item in [Step 6 - Create a PG deal line item](#step-6-create-a-pg-deal-line-item).

#### Optional JSON fields for deal line item profile

There are many optional fields available in the deal line item profile for targeting with the deal line item. For example, you can target
properties associated with inventory, inventory types, allowlists, blocklists, device types, and so forth. For more information on
available fields, see the [Profile Service](profile-service.md).

### Step 6: Create a PG deal line item

Finally, you'll need to create the deal line item to associate the deal ID and the deal line item profile you created in [Step 5 - Create a PG deal line item profile](#step-5-create-a-deal-line-item-profile).

To create a PG deal line item, do the following (for more information, see [Line Item Service](line-item-service---ali.md)):

1. Create a deal line item JSON (you'll need an existing advertiser ID, insertion order ID, deal ID, and profile ID).

    **Example JSON: PG deal line item with no budget**

    ```
    > cat deal_line_item.json
    {
        "line-item": {
            "ad_types": ["banner"],
            "auction_event": {
                "kpi_auction_type_id": 1,
                "payment_auction_type_id": 1,
                "revenue_auction_type_id": 1
            },
            "bid_object_type": "deal",
            "budget_intervals": [{
                "start_date": "2022-08-11 12:00:00"
            }],
            "deals": [{
                "id": 618159
            }],
            "insertion_orders": [{
                "id": 1363850
            }],
            "line_item_type": "standard_v2",
            "name": "Deal Line Item Example Line Item",
            "revenue_type": "cpm",
            "revenue_value": "5",
            "supply_strategies": {
                "managed": true,
                            "rtb": false,
                            "programmatic_guaranteed": false
            },
            "profile_id": 112548354,
            "valuation": {
                "min_revenue_value": null
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    **Example JSON: PG deal line item lifetime impression budget**

    ```
    > cat deal_line_item_lifetime.json
    {
        "line-item": {
            "ad_types": ["banner"],
            "auction_event": {
                "kpi_auction_type_id": 1,
                "payment_auction_type_id": 1,
                "revenue_auction_type_id": 1
            },
            "bid_object_type": "deal",
            "budget_intervals": [
                    {
                        "end_date": "2022-10-18 23:59:59",
                        "lifetime_budget_imps": 2586,
                        "start_date": "2022-10-11 12:00:00",
                        "timezone": "US/Pacific"
                    }
                ],
            "deals": [{
                "id": 618159
            }],
            "insertion_orders": [{
                "id": 1363850
            }],
            "line_item_type": "standard_v2",
            "name": "Deal Line Item Example Line Item",
            "revenue_type": "cpm",
            "revenue_value": "5",
            "supply_strategies": {
                "managed": true,
                            "rtb": false,
                            "programmatic_guaranteed": false
            },
            "profile_id": 112548354,
            "valuation": {
                "min_revenue_value": null
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. Make a `POST` request to the [https://api.appnexus.com/line-item](https://api.appnexus.com/line-item) endpoint using this deal line item JSON and an appropriate `advertiser_id` and `member_id`.

    **Example request: Deal line item no budget**

    ```
    > curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @deal_line_item.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?member_id=2378&advertiser_id=3410892'
    ```

    **Example request: Deal line item lifetime impression budget**

    ```
    > curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @deal_line_item_lifetime.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?member_id=2378&advertiser_id=3410892'
    ```

    **Example request: Deal line item daily revenue budget**

    ```
    > curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @deal_line_item_daily.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?member_id=2378&advertiser_id=3410892'
    ```

1. Check the response body of your request. If your request was successful, you’ll get a "`status`" of “`OK`” and you’ll see the updates you made.

1. Note the line item ID in the response body so you can identify this deal line item later to change its `state` (`active` or `inactive`) or modify it.
