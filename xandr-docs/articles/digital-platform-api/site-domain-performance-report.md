# Site domain performance report

The Site Domain Performance report can be used to view performance and optimization data by domain for a specific advertiser.

> [!TIP]
> To view performance and optimization data by domain for multiple advertisers, use the [Network Site Domain Performance](./network-site-domain-performance.md) report.

For instructions on retrieving a report, please see [Report Service](./report-service.md) or see the [example](#example) below. For an advertiser user, the advertiser ID is detected based on the user's authentication. For a network user, however, this report requires specifying the advertiser ID as part of the URL, for example:

```
https://api.appnexus.com/report?advertiser_id=ADVERTISER_ID
```

## Time frame

The `report_interval` field in the JSON request can be set to one of the following:

- yesterday
- last_7_days
- month_to_date
- month_to_yesterday

If you use the `start_date` and `end_date` fields to define the time range, the `start_date` must not be more than 45 days in the past. Since hourly data is not available for this report, `start_date` and `end_date` cannot be identical and must be formatted as `"YYYY-MM-DD"` rather than `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"`. Report data can be returned only for the UTC timezone.

**Data retention period**

Data retention period for this report is 45 days.

Also, you can filter by no more than 10 conversion pixels. Although `pixel_id` is groupable, we do not recommend that you group by this dimension since doing so will cause conversion events to then be shown in separate rows from impression and click events. We generally assume you want to view all of these events in a single row so as to be able to retrieve accurate and aggregated values for conversion rate and cost-per-conversion calculations. As a result, we instead recommend that you filter by `pixel_id` so you can retrieve conversion counts and related metrics for your most relevant pixel IDs. |

## Example

### Create JSON formatted report request

```
$ cat domain_performance

{
    "report":
    {
        "report_type": "site_domain_performance",
        "columns": [
            "day",
            "campaign",
            "booked_revenue",
            "imps",

        "emails": ["js@mynetwork.com"],
        "format": "csv"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the reporting service

In this example, we request execution of the report for advertiser `660`.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @domain_performance 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?advertiser_id=660'

{
    "response":{
        "status":"OK",
        "report_id":"07af1282c9485adcef49c95fa5d7496b"
    }
}
```

### Use the report ID to retrieve the report data

The standard response includes the report data and a Download URL that you can use to save the data to a file. If you want to get just the Download URL without the report data, pass `"without_data"` in the query string.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=07af1282c9485adcef49c95fa5d7496b'

### Use the download URL to save the report data to a file

You use the `"url"` field in the response to save the report data to a file. Simply make another `GET` call and identify the location and file that you want to save to. Be sure to use the file the extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST` request.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=495d03a7667bac467bb488043ae336e9' > /tmp/site_domain.csv
```
