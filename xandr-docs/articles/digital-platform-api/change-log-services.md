# Change Log services

## Overview

The read-only Change Log and Change Log Detail Services are used in conjunction with other services (listed below) to retrieve information about changes that have been made to a set of objects. This page describes the use of these two services to retrieve a list of the logged changes in which you are interested. The Change Log service is only available to users with the `"member"`, `"advertiser"`, or `"member_advertiser"` user type.

> [!NOTE]
> The Change Log service has some minor differences from other Xandr API services as mentioned below:
>
> - The `min_last_modified` option used for date filtering is replaced by `min_timestamp`.
> - The `last_modified` option is not supported. Use `created_on` instead.

## REST API for retrieving the ID of a change

| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `GET` | [https://api.appnexus.com/change-log?service=SERVICE&resource_id=ID](https://api.appnexus.com/change-log?service=SERVICE&resource_id=ID) | Retrieve ID of a change incurred to a resource. |
| `POST` | [https://api.appnexus.com/change-log](https://api.appnexus.com/change-log)<br>(Change log JSON) | Posting an ID of change for a resource. |

## JSON fields for Change Log service

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The Change Log service is read-only; however, some fields can be used in a `POST` call to filter the response. However, all the fields are not used in `POST` calls, so `GET` is recommended.
> - The Change Log service contains at least 6 months of data, if not more, for every service.

### Fields accepted as inputs to the endpoint

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `service` | string | The service used to make the change. Below are few of the examples of possible values:<br> - `insertion-order`<br> - `line-item`<br> - `campaign`<br> - `profile`<br><br>**Note:** Currently, `budget-splitter` service is in block-list.<br>**Required:** Yes<br>**Filter:** Yes |
| `resource_id` | int | The ID of the object used to make the change.<br>**Required:** Yes<br>**Filter:** Yes |
| `additional_fields` | string<br> - For `GET` requests, this is a group of comma separated strings.

For example, `"additional_fields":["request_source","user_id","object_json”]` | This field allows the users to add additional data in the response. The  `additional_fields` can include additional return fields. Examples of accepted values are:<br> - `request_source`<br> - `user_id`<br> - `object_json`<br>**Required:** No  <br>**Filter:** No |

## Examples

### Retrieve Change Log Details using `GET`

#### Step 1: Call `/change-log` to get transactions for a desired `resource_id`

`GET` to `/change-log`.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/change-log?service=line-item&resource_id=13984849'
{
"response": {
"change_logs": [

```

`GET` to `/change-log` with `"additional_fields"` parameter.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/change-log?service=line-item&resource_id=13984849&additional_fields=request_source,user_id,object_json'
{

},
...
],
"start_element": 0,

`GET` to `/change-log-detail`.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/change-log-detail?service=line-item&transaction_id=0ee74310-f580-5001-8007-2f71f84a5454'

### Retrieve Change Log Details using `POST`

> [!NOTE]
> The code samples in the steps below show how a user retrieves changes made to advertiser 5260730 between 17:00:00 on March 3, 2021 and 18:00:00 on March 3, 2021.

#### Step 1: Create a JSON-formatted change log request

The JSON file should include the `service` and `resource_id` of the change logs you want to view, as well as the `min_timestamp` and `max_timestamp` to limit change logs to a specific time period. You can also use `start_element` or `num_elements` in the query string.

Create `change-log` JSON.

```
$ cat change-log.json
{
"change-log" : {
"service" : "advertiser",
"resource_id": "5260730",
"min_timestamp" : "2021-03-03 17:00:00",
"max_timestamp" : "2021-03-03 18:00:00"
}
}
```

#### Step 2: `POST` the request to the Change Log Service

`POST` the JSON request to get back basic change log information, including the `transaction_id`.

`POST` to `/change-log`.

```
$ curl -b cookies -X POST -d @change-log.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/change-log'
{
"response": {
"change_logs": [
{
"transaction_id": "016ac252-aa30-5d10-a7a0-b5b3d88df832",
"created_on": "2021-03-03 17:16:07",
"resource_id": 5260730
}
],
"start_element": 0,
"num_elements": 100,
"count": 1,
"status": "OK"
}
}
```

#### Step 3: Create a JSON-formatted change log detail request

The JSON file should include the `service` and `transaction_id` of the change log for which details you want to view.

Create `change-log-detail` JSON.

```
$ cat change-log-detail.json
{
"change-log-detail" : {
"service" : "advertiser",
"transaction_id": "016ac252-aa30-5d10-a7a0-b5b3d88df832",
"previous_object": "true"
}
}
```

#### Step 4: `POST` the request to the Change Log Detail Service

`POST` the JSON request to get back a detailed change log for the change corresponding to the `transaction_id`.

`POST` to `/change-log-detail`.

```
$ curl -b cookies -X POST -d @change-log-detail.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/change-log-detail'
{
"response": {
"change_log_details": [
{
"transaction_id": "016ac252-aa30-5d10-a7a0-b5b3d88df832",
"member_id": 7823,
"raw_json":"{\"advertiser\":{\"id\":0,\"code\":\"0080459398\",...}",
"plugin_id": "",
"method": "POST",
"changes": [
{
"field_name": "allow_safety_pacing",
"old_value": null,
"new_value": null,
"changed": false
},
{
"field_name": "billing_address1",
"old_value": null,
"new_value": "New Address",
"changed": true
},
...
],
"session_id": "authn:206221:8d1c33b7fadc3:ams3",
"internal_txn": false,
"url": "https://api.appnexus.com/advertiser",
"request_source": "direct",
"num_of_changes": 25,
"created_on": "2021-03-03 17:16:07",
"user_id": [redacted],
"modified_by_admin": true,
"admin_id": 0,
"user_full_name": "Test",
"resource_id": 5260730,
"client_ip": "[redacted]",
"ip_info": "[redacted]"
}
],
"start_element": 0,
"num_elements": 1,
"count": 1,
"status": "OK"
}
}
```
