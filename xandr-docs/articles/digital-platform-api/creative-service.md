# Digital Platform API - Creative service

You can use the Creative Service to add creatives to our system. All creatives must be attached to an advertiser or publisher.

- You can view your advertiser ID by calling the [Advertiser Service](advertiser-service.md).
- You can view your publisher ID by calling the [Publisher Service](publisher-service.md).
- You can attach a creative to a publisher for use as a default creative for a placement. You would then attach the creative to a placement via its ID using the [Placement Service](placement-service.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Hosted and third-party Video and Audio services can only be accessed using the [Creative Vast Service](creative-vast-service.md). Hosted and third-party HTML creatives can only be accessed using the [Creative HTML Service](creative-html-service.md).

## Auditing

Xandr works with members who care deeply about brand and reputation. For this reason, we are careful to ensure that the advertisements
(creatives) that pass through our system are acceptable to all parties. For quality assurance, all creatives that serve on third-party inventory must be pre-registered using the Creative Service.

- Creatives are identified by their media_url (either a third-party adserver URL or a Content Delivery Network URL for a Flash, image, or video file).
- Xandr checks media_urls on a regular basis. If a file disappears, the creative will be treated as unaudited.
- Once a creative has passed Xandr's audit, certain changes to the creative cause it to be resubmitted for audit. For more details, see [Changes That Cause Re-Audit](#changes-that-cause-re-audit) below.

### Pixels

You use this array to add Xandr-approved and custom pixels to a creative. You can add up to five pixels for a creative.

Xandr-approved pixels are from trusted, commonly-used providers. Most of them do not cause the creative to be resubmitted for audit. To add a Xandr-approved pixel to a creative, you need to pass only the pixel_template_id and the number of params that the pixel requires. For further guidance, see the *Adding a Xandr-approved pixel to a creative* example in [Examples](#examples) below.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the [Pixel Template Service](pixel-template-service.md) to get information about these pixels, including whether or not they trigger re-audit.

Custom pixels are defined by you and do cause the creative to be resubmitted for audit. To add a custom pixel, you need to pass only the
format and, depending on the format, the content or url. For further guidance, see the *Adding a custom pixel to a creative* example in the [Examples](#examples) below.

> [!NOTE]
> To update or create a third-party pixel and/or attach third-party pixels to all creatives owned by the advertiser or network member, use the [Third-party Pixel service](third-party-pixel-service.md).

### First run/last run

To include the `first_run` and `last_run` fields in a GET response, pass `flight_info=true` in the query string. You can also filter for
creatives based on when they first and last served, as follows:

### Retrieve only creatives that have never served

Pass `never_run=true` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/creative?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&never_run=true'
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can use `never_run=true`in combination with other filters, but please note that it will always be an OR relationship. For example, if you pass both `never_run=true`and `min_first_run=2012-01-01 00:00:00` in the query string, you will be looking for creatives that have never served OR line items that first served on or after 2012-01-01.

### Retrieve only creatives that first served on or after a specific date

Pass `min_first_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/creative?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&min_first_run=2012-01-01 00:00:00'
```

### Retrieve only creatives that first served on or before a specific date

Pass `max_first_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/creative?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&max_first_run=2012-08-01 00:00:00'
```

### Retrieve only creatives first served within a specific date range

Pass
`min_first_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS&max_first_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/creative?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&min_first_run=2012-01-01 00:00:00&max_first_run=2012-08-01 00:00:00'
```

### Retrieve only creatives that last served on or after a specific date

Pass `min_last_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/creative?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&min_last_run=2012-01-01 00:00:00'
```

### Retrieve only creatives that last served on or before a specific date

Pass `max_last_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/creative?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&max_last_run=2012-08-01 00:00:00'
```

### Retrieve only creatives that last served within a specific date range

Pass
`min_last_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS&max_last_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/creative?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&min_last_run=2012-01-01 00:00:00&max_last_run=2012-08-01 00:00:00'
```

### Stats

> [!NOTE]
> The `stats`object has been deprecated (as of October 17, 2016). Use the [Report Service](report-service.md) to obtain statistical information instead.

## Changes that cause re-audit

Once a creative has passed Xandr audit (`audit_status` is `"audited"`), changing any of the following fields causes the creative to be
resubmitted for audit (`allow_audit` is set to `"pending"`):

- width
- height
- content
- media_url
- click_url
- template
- custom_macros
- media_subtypes
- language
- categories
- technical_attributes
- brand_id
- pixel_url
- pixels (if adding or removing a custom pixel or a Xandr-approved
  pixel)
- text_title (if text creative)
- text_description (if text creative)
- text_display_url (if text creative)
- pop_window_maximize (if pop creative)
- pop_is_tag_initiated (if pop creative and changing from false to true)
- video_attribute
- media_assets
- brand_url (not applicable to API users)
- alternative_landing_page_url
- native_attribute

Also, if the `audit_status` is `"no_audit"`, changing `allow_audit` from `"false"` to `"true"` causes the creative to be resubmitted for Xandr audit.

## Creative macros

Xandr has predefined some macros that can be used within the creative's `media_url`, `content`, `click_url`, and `pixel_url` fields.

### Click tracking example

```
"media_url": "https://ad.doubleclick.net/adi/N5364.Ivillage.com/B2965815.5;sz=728x90;click0=$
{CLICK_URL};ord=${CACHEBUSTER}?"
        
```

## Examples

> [!CAUTION]
> Exclude `audit_status` and `no_audit`in **PUT** calls to avoid errors.

### Adding a banner image creative (hosted)

When uploading a standard banner image creative for hosting with Xandr:

Once the creative has been registered, the content will be stored on the CDN, and the creative will be given a media_url such as [https://cdn.adnxs.com/p/29/23/21/a0/292321a0bea05427598914c8bb626032.jpg](https://cdn.adnxs.com/p/29/23/21/a0/292321a0bea05427598914c8bb626032.png).

Auditing: By default, the creative will be submitted for auditing by Xandr. If you don't want the creative to be audited, you must include `allow_audit` and set it to `false`. Alternately, if you want to audit the creative yourself, you must include `is_self_audited` and set it to `true`.

```

      ...
   }
}
```

### Add a mobile banner image creative (hosted)

In order for mobile creatives to pass Xandr platform audit, you need to pass the `mobile` object with an alternative URL that will display correctly in a desktop browser when the creative is clicked.

```
$ cat creative

### Adding a banner flash creative (third-party URL)

When adding a third-party URL for a banner flash creative:

Auditing: By default, the creative will be submitted for auditing by Xandr. If you don't want the creative to be audited, you must include `allow_audit` and set it to `false`. Alternately, if you want to audit the creative yourself, you must include `is_self_audited` and set it to `true`.

      },
      ...
      "audit_status": "pending",
      ...
   }
}
```

### Adding a MediaMind expandable creative (third-party URL)

In this example, note that the `media_url` field provides the third-party URL for the expandable creative, and the template array specifies template 108, which is the Xandr standard template for creatives of the `"MediaMind Expandable"` media subtype and the `"url-js"` format.

Auditing: By default, the creative will be submitted for auditing by Xandr. If you don't want the creative to be audited, you must include `allow_audit` and set it to `false`. Alternately, if you want to audit the creative yourself, you must include `is_self_audited` and set it to `true`.

```
$ cat creative

{
   "creative": {
      "media_url": "https://bs.serving-sys.com/BurstingPipe/adServer.bs?ncu=$$${CLICK_URL_ENC}$$&cn=rsb&c=28&

      "template": {"id":108},
      "width": 300,
      "height": 250,
      "campaigns":[
          {"id": 58990},
          {"id": 58991}
      ]
   }
}

$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @creative 'https://api.appnexus.com/creative?advertiser_id=35'

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "id":12,
      ...
      "media_url":"https://bs.serving-sys.com/BurstingPipe/adServer.bs?ncu=$$${CLICK_URL_ENC}$$&cn=rsb&c=28&
          pli=2980019&PluID=0&w=300&h=250&ord=${CACHEBUSTER}&ucm=true",

          "id": 108,
          "name": "Standard",
          "media_subtype_id": 11,
          "format_id": 2
      },
      ...
      "audit_status": "pending",
      ...
   }
}
```

### Adding a Pointroll expandable creative (third-party HTML tag)

In this example, note that the content field provides the JavaScript tag for the expandable creative, and the template array specifies template 159, which is the Xandr standard template for creatives of the `"Pointroll Expandable"` media subtype and the `"raw-html"` format.

Auditing: By default, the creative will be submitted for auditing by Xandr. If you don't want the creative to be audited, you must include `allow_audit` and set it to `false`. Alternately, if you want to audit the creative yourself, you must include `is_self_audited` and set it to `true`.

```
$ cat creative

### Adding a popup image creative (third-party URL)

In this example, note that the `media_url` field provides the third-party URL for the popup image creative, and the template array specifies template 10, which is the standard Xandr rendering template for the `"Popup"` media subtype and the `"url-js"` format. If you don't specify a template in the request, you must pass format as `"image"` and `media_subtype` as `"popup"`.

```

### Adding a popunder image creative (third-party URL)

In this example, note that the `media_url` field provides the third-party URL for the popunder image creative, and the template array specifies template 17, which is the standard Xandr rendering template for the `"Popunder"` media subtype and the `"url-js"` format. If you don't include a template in the request, you must pass format as `"image"` and `media_subtype` as `"popunder"`.

### Adding a creative that uses a custom rendering template

In this example, the POST request adds a hosted flash banner creative to Xandr. The creative uses a custom creative template, which is designed to render the creative with a border when it is served. Custom macros in the template allow the trafficker to specify the HTML color code and size (in pixels) or the border.

```
$ cat creative

{
   "creative": {
      "template": {"id":252},
      "width": 300,
      "height": 250,

### Adding a secure creative

When uploading a non-secure creative, you can also upload a version to serve on SSL inventory as follows:

> [!NOTE]
> You can check the ssl audit status of a creative by making a simple GET request. The `ssl_status` field in the response tells you the audit status. The creative will be eligible to serve on secure inventory only once it passes the audit and the `ssl_status` is `"approved"`. A third-party creative will pass our audit only if all calls in the ad chain go through secure servers. If the creative fails the ssl audit, you can resubmit it for ssl auditing by changing the `ssl_status` field to `"pending"`.

```
$ cat creative

{
   "creative": {
      "media_url": "https://creative.com/123",
      "media_url_secure": "https://creative.com/123",
      "template": {"id":2},
      "allow_ssl_audit": true
      "format": "image",
      "width": 300,
      "height": 250,
      "campaigns": [
         {"id":58990},
         {"id":58991}
      ]
   }
}

$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @creative 'https://api.appnexus.com/creative?advertiser_id=35'

{
   "response": {
      "status":"OK",
      "id":13
      ...
      "audit_status":"pending",
      ...
      "ssl_status":"pending",
      ...
   }
}
```

### Submitting a creative for priority audit

If you have a supplemental services agreement with Xandr for priority audits, you can submit a creative for priority audit (auditing within 2 hours during business hours) by setting the `sla` field to 2. The `sla_eta` field in the response will provide an estimated finish time for the audit.

```
$ cat creative

{
   "creative": {
      "media_url": "https://creative.com/456",
      "template": {"id":2},
      "width": 300,
      "height": 250,
      "campaigns": [
         {"id":58990},
         {"id":58991}
      ],
      "sla": 2
   }
}

$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @creative 'https://api.appnexus.com/creative?advertiser_id=35'

{
   "response": {
      "status": "OK",
      "id": 469340,
      ...
      "audit_status": "pending",
      ...
      "sla": "2",
      "sla_eta": "2012-01-13 22:43:33",
      ...
   }
}
```

### Canceling a creative audit

If you have submitted a creative for Xandr audit, and the `audit_status` is `"pending"`, you can cancel the audit and not be charged the auditing fee by making a `PUT` request with `allow_audit` set to `false`. The `audit_status` field will be `"no_audit"` in the response.

```
$ cat creative

{
   "creative": {
      "allow_audit":false
   }
}

$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X PUT -d @creative 'https://api.appnexus.com/creative?id=469340&advertiser_id=35'

{
   "response": {
      "status": "OK",
      "id": 469340,
      ...
      "audit_status":"no_audit",
      ...
   }
}
```

### Viewing audit stats for all creatives

In this example, `"audit_stats=true"` is passed in the query string of the `GET` call. This returns the number of creatives with each Xandr, Microsoft, and Google audit status.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/creative?audit_stats=true'

{
    "response": {
        "status": "OK",
        "count": 30,
        "start_element": 0,
        "num_elements": 100,
        "creatives": [
            {
                "total": 30,
                "appnexus_audit": {
                    "no_audit": 10,
                    "pending": 18,
                    "approved": 0,
                    "rejected": 1
                },
                "microsoft_audit": {
                    "no_audit": 10,
                    "pending": 18,
                    "approved": 1,
                    "rejected": 1
                }
            }
        ],
        "dbg_info": {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

### Adding a Xandr-approved pixel to a creative

This example walks you through the process of adding the Xandr-approved Evidon AdChoices Icon pixel to a creative.

1. First, you need to find out the `pixel_template_id` and the number of parameters you must define for the pixel. You use the [Pixel Template Service](pixel-template-service.md) to get this information.

    ```
    $ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/pixel-template'
    
    {
        "response": {
            "status": "OK",
            "count": 3,
            "start_element": 0,
            "num_elements": 100,
            "pixel-templates": [
                {
                    "id": 1,
                    "name": "Evidon AdChoices Icon",
                    "format": "raw-js",
                    "content": "(function() {document.write('<sc'+'ript type=\"text/javascript\"' + ((\"https:\"
                     == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://c.betrad.com\" : \"https://c.betrad.com\") +
                     '/surly.js?;ad_wxh=${CREATIVE_SIZE};coid=${P1};nid=${P2};${P3}\"></scr'+'ipt>');}());",
                    "num_required_params": 2,
                    "require_reaudit": false
                },
                {
                    "id": 2,
                    "name": "Brilig Impression Tracker",
                    "format": "url-image",
                    "num_required_params": 1,
                    "require_reaudit": false,
                    "url": "https://p.brilig.com/contact/bct?pid=${P1}&_ct=pixel&adid=${CP_ID}&action=1"
                },
                ...
            ],
            "dbg_info": {
                ...
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. The Evidon AdChoices Icon pixel is the first in the response. You note that id is 1. You also note that `num_required_params` is 2. This means that, when adding the pixel to your creative, you must provide values for {P1} and {P2} in the pixel content.

1. You create the JSON-formatted file for adding the pixel to the creative. In the file, you set `pixel_template_id` to 2, and you set
param_1 and param_2 to the values for {P1} and {P2} in the pixel content.

    > [!CAUTION]
    > The pixels array will be completely overwritten with your JSON. Therefore, if the pixels array on the creative already includes any pixels, be sure to specify them in your JSON array as well. For more details, see [Creative Service](creative-service.md).

    ```
    $ cat creative_update
    
    {
        "creative": {
            "pixels": [
                {
                    "pixel_template_id": 1,
                    "param_1":"12",
                    "param_2":"34"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

1. Finally, you make a `PUT` call to update the creative. The pixels array in the response then shows that the pixel has been added. The two parameters are defined and have been populated in the pixel content.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Evidon AdChoices Icon pixel does not cause the creative to require re-auditing, `audit_status` has not be reverted to `"pending"`.

    ```

### Adding a custom pixel to a creative

In this example, the `PUT` request adds a custom url-js pixel to creative 503577. In the JSON-formatted file, the format is set to `"url-js"`, and the url is set to the location of the JavaScript that you want to serve with the creative.

> [!NOTE]
> In the response that `audit_status` is `"pending"`; this is because adding a custom pixel to a creative causes the creative to be resubmitted for audit.
> [!CAUTION]
> The pixels array will be completely overwritten with the information in this file. Therefore, if the creative already includes any pixels, be sure to specify them in the file as well.

### Adding a native creative

This is the new native attribute. When adding a native creative with the new attribute, use template id 39461.

Step 1: Upload the asset to the [creative upload service](creative-upload-service---file-format.md).

```
curl -X POST -H 'Authorization:hbapi:21816:58f909dfa3405:nym2' --form "type=image" --form "file=@./NATIVE.JPG" 'https://api.appnexus.com/creative-upload?member_id=123'
```

The `media_asset_id` is returned.
