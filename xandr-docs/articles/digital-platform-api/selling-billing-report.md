## Example

### Create JSON formatted report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` of `"seller_pricing_report"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the `"format"` in which the data should be returned (`csv`, `excel`, or `html`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md).

```
$ cat seller_pricing_report.json

{
    "report": {
        "format": "csv",
        "report_interval": "last_48_hours",
        "columns": [
            "seller_member_name",
            "buyer_member_name",
            "imps",
            "clicks",
            "convs"
        ],
        "report_type": "seller_pricing_report"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the reporting service specifying a member ID by replacing `INSERT_DESIRED_MEMBER_ID`

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @seller_pricing_report_request.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?member_id=INSERT_DESIRED_MEMBER_ID'

{
  "response": {
    "status": "OK",
    "report_id": "9282cde2a86670d9861b77b8fc0954ad", <=== COPY THIS report_id as you will need it to check the status of your report and to download your report
    "existing": false,
    "cached": true
    }
  }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service

Make a `GET` call with the Report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=9282cde2a86670d9861b77b8fc0954ad'

{
  "response": {
    "status": "OK",
    "report": {
      "name": null,
      "created_on": "2015-11-17 22:15:52",
      "cache_hit": true,
      "fact_cache_hit": true,
      "fact_cache_error": null,
      "json_request": "{\"report\":{\"format\":\"csv\",\"report_interval\":\"last_48_hours\",\"columns\":[\"seller_member_name\",\"buyer_member_name\",\"imps\",\"clicks\",\"convs\"],\"report_type\":\"seller_pricing_report\",\"filters\":[{\"seller_member_id\":\"2414\"},{\"is_delivered\":{\"value\":[\"1\"],\"operator\":\"=\"}},{\"is_valid_seller\":{\"value\":[\"1\"],\"operator\":\"=\"}}]}}",

      "user_id": "171989",
      "entity_id": "0",
      "started_on": "1970-01-01 00:00:01",

      "query_time": null,
      "url": "report-download?id=9282cde2a86670d9861b77b8fc0954ad"
    },
    "execution_status": "ready"
    }
  }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the Report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and Report ID in the `url` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!TIP]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=9282cde2a86670d9861b77b8fc0954ad' > seller_pricing_report.csv
```
