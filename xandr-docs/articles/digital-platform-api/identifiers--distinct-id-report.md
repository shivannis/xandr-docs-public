# Digital Platform API - Identifiers - Distinct ID report

Platform Reporting on Industry IDs provides an insight into the delivery, performance and unique reach across Industry IDs (RampID,
NetID, UID2) alongside device based IDs. The Identifiers-Distinct IDs Report allows you to understand the total number of uniques by UID2,
RampID, No cookies, and Cookies/Device IDs.

You can use the report to determine the following:

- The availability of the ID types across various impressions that was purchased.
- The average eCPM for the ID type.
- The unique IDs present.

## Time frame

The `report_interval` field in the JSON request can be set to one of the following:

- custom
- current_hour
- last_hour
- today
- yesterday
- last_7_days
- last_48_hours
- month_to_date
- quarter_to_date
- lifetime

To run a report for a custom time frame, set the `start_date` and `end_date` fields in your report request. For more details about these
fields, see [Report Service](report-service.md).

## Data retention period

This report's data is retained for 90 days. For more information about how quickly reporting data is processed, see [Availability of Reporting Data](../monetize/availability-of-reporting-data.md).

## Dimensions

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - The **Filter?** column shows whether a dimension can be used as a filter as well as being used to group by.
> - Some dimensions have attributes. Dimension attributes are a more granular element of data about the parent dimension. If a dimension has attributes, the name of its attributes will appear below it using the following syntax: `"Dimension_Name:Attribute_Name"`.
> - For all revenue fields, the currency is defined by the `Buying Currency` field.

## Examples

The JSON file should include the report_type, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and report_interval that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (month, day), and specify the format in which the data should be returned (csv, excel, or html). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](report-service.md).

### Create the JSON report request

### Retrieve the status of the report

Make a `GET` call with the report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is
`"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookie -c cookie -s "https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=42fcca4a9bb1ad00a477374e64e2bf88"
{
    "response": {
        "status": "OK",

            "name": "",
            "created_on": "2023-07-04 15:35:23",
            "cache_hit": false,
            "fact_cache_hit": false,
            "fact_cache_error": "",
            "json_request": "{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"identity_reporting_distinct\",\"columns\":[\"id_type\",\"avg_imps_per_unique\",\"imps\",\"cost\",\"eCPM\",\"eCTR\",\"uniques\"],\"report_interval\":\"last_48_hours\",\"format\":\"csv\",\"grouping\":{\"additional_grouping_sets\":[],\"unselected_implicit_groupings\":[],\"additional_groups_on_bottom\":true},\"timezone\":\"UTC\",\"filters\":[{\"member_id\":\"668\"}],\"reporting_decimal_type\":\"decimal\",\"use_cache\":true},\"extraction_version\":\"refactored\",\"end_date\":1688482800,\"start_date\":1688310000,\"user_id\":\"200537\"}",

        },
        "execution_status": "ready",
```

### Download the report

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and report ID in the `url` field of the response to your previous `GET` call. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the file format that you specified in your initial `POST`.

```
curl -b cookie -c cookie -s "https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=42fcca4a9bb1ad00a477374e64e2bf88" > identity_reporting_distinct.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.
> - There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
