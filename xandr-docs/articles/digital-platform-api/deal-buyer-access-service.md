# Digital Platform API - Deal buyer access service

This read-only service lets buyers view information about the negotiated deals they have with Xandr's UI sellers and external supply partners. A deal may provide a buyer preferential pricing, access to exclusive inventory, reduced competition on inventory, or other opportunities. Each deal is valid for a single buyer, but note that inventory included in a deal may be encompassed by deals with other buyers as well.

Buyers can use the `deal_targets` field in the [Profile Service](./profile-service.md) to target deals. Sellers can use the [Deal Service](./deal-service.md) to set up and manage deals.

| Field | Type (Length) | Description |

| `active` | boolean | If `true`, the deal is active. Note that the deal will be available to the buyer only when this field is `true`, `start_date` is in the past (or `null`), and `end_date` is in the future (or `null`). |
| `ask_price` | int | The  price associated with the deal. This is the minimum amount the seller will accept for this inventory. |
| `audit_status_option` | string | Specifies how the deal handles creatives.<br> - `none`: Creatives use existing ad quality settings.<br> - `provisional`: Creatives in `"pending"` audit status will serve. Once these creatives are audited, the existing ad quality settings are used.<br> - `max_trust`: Any creative is allowed to serve for this deal.<br>Creatives specifically listed in the [Creatives](#creatives) object will override these settings. |
| `brands` | array of objects | The brands of creatives that are eligible for the deal. For more details, see [Brands](#brands) below. |
| `brand_restrict` | Boolean | Specifies whether the deal is restricted only to the brands listed in the [Brands](#brands) object.<br> - `true`: Deal is restricted only to the listed brands.<br> - `false`: Other brands are also allowed to serve. |
| `buyer` | object | The buying member who can target this deal. For more details, see [Buyer](#buyer) below. |

| `currency` | enum | The currency for the `floor_price`. For a full list of available currencies, use the read-only [Currency Service](./currency-service.md).  |

| `end_date` | timestamp | The day and time when the deal stops being available to the buyer. Null corresponds to "indefinitely". |
| `floor_price` | double | **Deprecated**. Refer to the `ask_price` field instead. The minimum CPM value that the buyer must bid to be eligible for the deal.<br><br>**Note**:<br>If `use_deal_floor` is `false`, `floor_price` will be `0`. In this case, note that although `0` is shown as the floor price, no deal floor is applied; if the seller has any other floors (in placements or yield management profiles), they will be applied, or if the seller does not have any other floors, the standard second-price auction mechanics will apply. |
| `id` | int | The ID of the deal. |
| `languages` | array of objects | The language associated with creatives that are eligible for the deal. For more details, see [Languages](#languages) below. |

| `seller` | object | The selling member who is offering the deal. For more details, see [Seller](#seller) below. |
| `sizes` | array of objects | The sizes of creatives that are eligible for the deal. For more details, see [Size Targets](#sizes) below.<br><br>**Note**: If this array is not present in the response, there are no creative size requirements for the deal. |

| `start_date` | timestamp | The day and time when the deal starts being available to the buyer. Null corresponds to "immediately". |
| `suggested_min_bid_price` | int | The minimum amount that will likely clear the ask price. This is the sum of the `ask_price` and the auction service charge specified in your Xandr contract. For deals with external suppliers, this amount will include additional margin to account for discrepancies.<br>Bidding the `suggested_min_bid_price` helps ensure that you are eligible for the deal but there is no guarantee that your bid will win. |

### Seller

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `id` | int | **Read-only**. The member ID of the seller. |
| `name` | string | **Read-only**. The member name of the seller. |

### Buyer

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|

| `bidder_id` | int | The bidder ID of the member. For Xandr's UI buyers, this will always be 2. |

### Type

The `Type` object contains the following fields.

| Field | Type (Length) | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `id` | int | The ID representing the type of deal. Possible values:<br>`1` = Open Auction<br>In an `"Open Auction"`, **buyers targeting the deals and buyers targeting the inventory via other means compete for the impression**. If a buyer targeting a deal submits the highest bid and the bid clears the deal's floor, that buyer wins the auction, paying either the second-highest bid or the deal floor price, whichever is higher. If one of the non-deal buyers submits the highest bid, that buyer wins the auction, paying either the second-highest bid or ECP, whichever is higher. <br><br>`2` = Private Auction<br>In a `"Private Auction"`, **buyers targeting the private deals compete for the impression first**. Then, if none of the deal buyers win, the auction is opened to buyers targeting the inventory via other means. If a buyer targeting a deal submits a bid higher than the deal's floor and higher than any other private auction bids, that buyer wins the auction, paying either the second-highest bid from the private auction or the deal floor price, whichever is higher. If no private auction deals clear their floors, the highest bid in the open auction wins, paying either the second-highest bid from the open auction or ECP, whichever is higher.<br><br>`3` = First Look<br>Deals considered `"First Look"` are offered only by external supply partners and have extremely varied auction logic depending on both the supply partner and the seller.

### View all deals that have not expired

In this example, assuming today is December 4, 2018, we want to find all deals that have not expired. To do this, we pass the `min_end_date=2018-12-04` filter in the query string. Note, however, that deals with no end date will not show up in the response.
