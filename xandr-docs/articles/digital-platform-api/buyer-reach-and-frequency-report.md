# Digital Platform API - Buyer Reach and Frequency report

The Buyer Reach and Frequency report shows you the information associated with two parameters: **"reach"** and **"frequency"**. **"reach"** is the number of unique devices or persons exposed to ads. **"frequency"** is the average number of times each unique device or person was exposed to advertisements. It helps to draw meaningful conclusions about the impact of cross device on conversion use cases. In short, buyers can have an insight on how cross device impacted the number of times a single person saw their ads across all their devices using this report as this report shows historical reach and average frequency on your buying.

The Buyer Reach and Frequency Report offers flexible filtering to analyze unique devices by facilitating below procedure:

- Pull a **basic running total** of unique devices for their active Line Items or Insertion Orders.
- Pull unique devices for these objects over a **defined period of time** (for example, past week).
- You can **filter and group on specific criteria**, which will provide an accurate unique device count across the specified criteria. For example, the count of unique devices across Line Items A, B, and D, in the US and Canada, for the past month.

## Time frame

The `report_interval` field in the JSON request can be set to one of the following:

- custom
- today
- last_hour
- last_24_hours
- yesterday
- last_48_hours
- last_2_days
- last_7_days
- last_14_days
- last_30_days
- last_month
- month_to_date
- quarter_to_date
- lifetime

### Data retention period

Data in this report is retained for 90 days.

> [!NOTE]
> To run a report for a custom time frame, set the `start_date` and `end_date` fields in your report request. For more details about these fields, see [Report Service](report-service.md).

| `estimated_people_reach` **(currently available in the US only)** | int | `269,266` | unique devices / device density factor | The estimated number of people reached, deduplicated across the user-specified dimensions. |

> [!NOTE]
> The metric **`estimated_people_reach`** is currently available in the US only. This model considers the unique devices reached at the zip code level, and utilizes publicly available US census data for the total population of each zip code, in order to estimate the number of people reached for that zip code. This zip code level data is then aggregated when a report is pulled by the API so that the buyer can view it at any level of granularity that is provided by the existing dimensions in the report.
>
> [Advanced Frequency Management (AFM)](../invest/advanced-frequency-management.md), which is currently in **beta**, does not take universal identifier (Universal ID) into account. This is subject to change as the feature would move into GA. Line items utilising Universal ID targeting should avoid using AFM until this is completely adapted.

## Examples

### Create the JSON report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` of `"buyer_approximate_unique_users_hourly"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and report_interval that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (year, month, day), and specify the format in which the data should be returned (csv, excel, or html). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](report-service.md).

```
$ cat buyer_approximate_unique_users_hourly

{"report":
    {
        "report_type":"buyer_approximate_unique_users_hourly",
        "columns":[
            "hour",
            "buyer_member_id",
            "media_type",
            "supply_type",
            "creative",
            "line_item_id",
            "imps",
            "average_impression_frequency",
            "cross_device_incremental_imps"
        ],
        "report_interval":"last_48_hours",
        "format":"csv"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the Report Service

`POST` the JSON request to get back a report ID.

```
$ curl -b cookies -X post -d @buyer_approximate_unique_users_hourly "https://api.appnexus.com/report?advertiser_id=789"

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"09b6979a6a4c3805bdac8921378d3622"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the Report Service

Make a `GET` call with the report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is
`"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=09b6979a6a4c3805bdac8921378d3622'

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report":{
         "name":null,
         "created_on":"2016-12-11 19:15:48",
         "json_request": "{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"buyer_approximate_unique_users_hourly\",
             \"columns\":[\"hour\",\"buyer_member_id\",
             \"media_type\",\"supply_type\",\"creative\",\"line_item_id\",
             \"imps\",\"average_impression_frequency\",\"cross_device_incremental_imps\"],
             \"report_interval\":\"last_48_hours\",\"format\":\"csv\",\"filters\":[{\"advertiser_id\":\"789\"}]}}",
             "url":"report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592"
      },
      "execution_status":"ready"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the Report Download Service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and report ID in the `url` field of the response to your previous `GET` call. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the file format that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!NOTE]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592' > /tmp/buyer_approximate_unique_users_hourly.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
