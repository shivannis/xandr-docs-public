# Digital Platform API - Publisher Analytics

The Publisher Analytics report can be used to view revenue and profit data across a specific publisher's sites and placements. This report is available to both network and publisher users.

For instructions on retrieving a report, see the [Report Service](report-service.md) or the [examples](#examples) below. This report requires that a publisher ID be specified as part of the URL as follows:

```
https://api.appnexus.com/report?publisher_id=PUBLISHER_ID
```

## Time frame

The `report_interval` field in the JSON request can be set to one of the following:

- current_hour
- last_hour
- today
- yesterday
- last_48_hours
- last_7_days
- last_30_days
- month_to_date
- month_to_yesterday
- quarter_to_date
- last_month
- lifetime

### Data retention period

Most data in this report is maintained permanently (exceptions noted below). After:

- 100 days, you are no longer able to report on hourly data. However, daily, monthly and cumulative intervals are still available.
- 14 months, you are no longer able to report on individual:
  - Creatives
  - Placements
  - Brands

In some cases Analytics reports can show delivery that does not match Lifetime QuickStats for a given advertiser or publisher. This is due to the way that Analytics reporting data older than 100 days and 14 months are aggregated. The data from Billing reports are kept in non-aggregated form indefinitely.

> [!NOTE]
> To run a report for a custom time frame, set the `start_date` and `end_date` fields in your report request. For more details about these fields, see [Report Service](report-service.md).
