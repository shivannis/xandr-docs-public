# Digital Platform API - Curator analytics report

> [!NOTE]
> This report is only available to curators.

The Curator Analytics Report provides curators insight into how money is flowing from demand to supply within their curated marketplace.

For instructions on retrieving a report, see [Report Service](report-service.md) or the [Example](#example) below.

## Time frame

The `report_interval` field in the JSON request can be set to one of the following:

- last_hour
- today
- yesterday
- month_to_date
- last_month
- lifetime

**Data retention period**

Data in this report is retained for 1100 days.

> [!NOTE]
> To run a report for a custom time frame, set the `start_date` and `end_date` fields in your report request. For more details about these fields, see [Report Service](./report-service.md).

**Time ranges including dates occurring greater than 45 days ago**

If you create Curator Analytics reports with the `report_interval` set to `"lifetime"`, your report (regardless of metrics included) will be added to a special queue for "resource-intensive" reports. As a result, the report may take longer than usual to complete. In addition, these resource-intensive reports may, due to the amount of data being requested, fail before being completed. If your report fails to complete, you will receive a notification. If your report request fails or is deleted, you can:

- rerun the report at a later time.
- use a report type other than `curator_analytics`.
- alter the way you structure your reports (if possible) so they do not include dates greater than 45 days ago.

## Example

### Create the JSON-formatted report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` of `"curator_analytics"`, as well as the `columns` (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (year, month, day), and specify the format in which the data should be returned (csv, excel, or html). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md).

```
$ cat curator_analytics

{
    "report": {
        "columns": [
            "hour",
            "buyer_member_name",
            "curated_deal",
            "imps",
            "curator_revenue",
            "curator_margin"
        ],
        "format": "csv",
        "report_interval": "today",
        "report_type": "curator_analytics"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the report service

```
$ curl -b cookies -X POST -d @curator_analytics 'https://api.appnexus.com/report'

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"6b177543a9411ffa67b09bdf5e76cac1"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service**

Make a `GET` call with the Report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=6b177543a9411ffa67b09bdf5e76cac1'
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report":{
         "name":null,
         "created_on":"2020-08-25 13:03:37",
         "json_request":"{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"curator_analytics\",\"columns\":[\"hour\",\"buyer_member_name\",\"curated_deal\",\"imps\",\"curator_revenue\",\"curator_margin\"],\"report_interval\":\"today\",\"format\":\"csv\",\"grouping\":{\"additional_grouping_sets\":[],\"unselected_implicit_groupings\":[],\"additional_groups_on_bottom\":true},\"timezone\":\"UTC\",\"filters\":[{\"member_id\":\"123456\"}],\"reporting_decimal_type\":\"decimal\",\"use_cache\":true},\"extraction_version\":\"refactored\",\"end_date\":1598400000,\"start_date\":1598313600,\"user_id\":\"987654\"}",
         "url": "report-download?id=6b177543a9411ffa67b09bdf5e76cac1"
      },
      "execution_status":"ready"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the Report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and Report ID in the `url` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!NOTE]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=6b177543a9411ffa67b09bdf5e76cac1' > /tmp/curator_analytics.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
