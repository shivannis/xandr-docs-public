## Example

### Create the JSON-formatted report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` of `"seller_deal_metrics_report"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the `"format"` in which the data should be returned (`csv`, `excel`, or `html`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md).

```
$ cat seller_deal_metrics_report
 
{
    "report": {
        "report_type": "seller_deal_metrics_report",
        "columns": [
            "hour",
            "buyer_member_name",
            "deal_name",
            "start_date",
            "end_date",
            "bids",
            "average_net_bid",
            "imps_won",
            "seller_revenue",
            "reject_count"
        ],
        "report_interval": "last_7_days",
        "format": "csv"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the reporting service

```
$ curl -b cookies -X POST -d @seller_deal_metrics_report 'https://api.appnexus.com/report'
{
    "response": {
        "report_id": "2630ab93193a0b14257f154b7912ac5f",

            "user::write_limit": 60,
            "read_limit": 100,
            "write_limit": 60,
            "user::read_limit_seconds": 60,

            "output_term": "report_id"
        }
    }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service

Make a `GET` call with the Report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=2630ab93193a0b14257f154b7912ac5f'

            "output_term": "report"
        }
    }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the Report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and Report ID in the `url` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the`"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!TIP]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=2630ab93193a0b14257f154b7912ac5f' > /tmp/seller_deal_metrics_report.csv
```
