# Content Search service

> [!NOTE]
> This service is currently available to a limited set of clients and Microsoft employees only.

Xandr admins can use this read-only service to search for creative IDs that have not been deleted and have not expired, based on the `content` and `media_url` attributes of a creative.

> [!NOTE]
> After using this service to retrieve creative IDs, you can use other services to lookup additional data. For example, to find out who a particular creative belongs to, you would make a `GET` call with the creative ID to the [Creative Service](creative-service.md).

## REST API

| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `GET` | [https://api.appnexus.com//creative-content-search?q=xxx](https://api.appnexus.com//creative-content-search?q=xxx) | Search for creative IDs based on terms in `content` and `media_url`. |

### Rules

- **For creative IDs to be returned, ALL search terms must match either** `content` **or** `media_url`**.**
- **Queries must be between 3 and 15 characters.** Queries outside this range will not return results.
- **This service does not return expired creatives.**
- **This service returns only creative IDs.** If more information is required; such as who the creative belongs to, or if you want to join the creative table with other tables, use the IDs returned in future queries/lookups. For more details, see the [example](#example) below.

## JSON fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `id` | int | The ID of the creative. |
