## Example

### Create the JSON-formatted report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` `"buyer_deal_metrics_report"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (year, month, day), and specify the format in which the data should be returned (csv, excel, or html). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](report-service.md).

```
$ cat buyer_deal_metrics_report

{
    "report":
    {
        "report_type":"buyer_deal_metrics_report",
        "columns":[
            "hour",
            "seller_member_name",
            "deal_name",
            "start_date",
            "end_date",
            "bids",
            "imps_won",
            "reject_count",
            "media_cost"
        ],
        "report_interval":"last_7_days",
        "format":"csv"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the reporting service

```
$ curl -b cookies -X POST -d @buyer_deal_metrics_report 'https://api.appnexus.com/report'
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"097f59fc3ab7d02c5d60db42081d9b69"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service

Make a `GET` call with the Report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=097f59fc3ab7d02c5d60db42081d9b69'
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report":{
         "name":null,
         "created_on":"2010-05-25 19:19:53",
         "json_request":"{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"buyer_deal_metrics_report\",\"columns\":[\"hour\",
            \"buyer_member_name\",\"deal_name\",\"start_date\",\"end_date\",\"bids\",\"imps_won\",\"media_cost\"],
            \"row_per\":[\"hour\",\"buyer_member_id\",\"deal_id\"],
            \"report_interval\":\"last_7_days\"}}",
         "url": "report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592"
      },
      "execution_status":"ready"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the Report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and Report ID in the `url` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!NOTE]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592' > /tmp/buyer_deal_metrics_report.csv
```

> [!TIP]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
