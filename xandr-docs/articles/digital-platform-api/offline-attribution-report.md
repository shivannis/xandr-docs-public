# Digital Platform API - Offline attribution report

The Offline Attribution report is used to analyze your line item's performance in influencing in-store purchases among your target audiences. The Offline Attribution report is only accessible to clients who have Offline Sales Attribution enabled for their line items.

For instructions on retrieving a report, please see [Report Service](./report-service.md) or the [example](#example) below. This report requires specifying the advertiser ID as part of the URL, for example:

```
 https://api.appnexus.com/report?advertiser_id=ADVERTISER_ID
```

## Time frame

The `report_interval` field in the JSON request can be set to one of the following:

- custom
- last_7_available_days
- last_14_available_days
- last_30_available_days
- last_365_days

### Data retention period

This report has a daily time granularity and can retrieve data from the past 120 days.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - To run a report for a custom time frame, set the `start_date` and `end_date` fields in your report request. For more details about these fields, see [Report Service](./report-service.md).
> - You can't make a specific time zone selection because NCS data uses the time zone(s) from where sales take place.

## Example

### Create JSON formatted report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` of `"offline_attribution"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and the `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the `"format"` in which the data should be returned (`"csv"`, `"excel"`, or `"html"`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md).

```
$ cat report-request.json

{
    "report": {
        "report_type": "offline_attribution",
        "format": "csv",
        "report_interval": "last_365_days",
        "columns": [
            "month",
            "member_id",
            "line_item_id",
            "split_id",
            "all_outlet_adjusted_total_spend",
            "imps",
            "analysis_rejection_reason"
        ],
        "orders": [
            "member_id",
            "line_item_id",
            "split_id"
        ],
        "filters": [{
            "line_item_id": [14545960, 14545978]
        }]
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the reporting service

In this example, we request execution of the report for advertiser 660.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @offline_attribution 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?advertiser_id=660'

{
    "response":{
        "status":"OK",
        "report_id":"07af1282c9485adcef49c95fa5d7496b"
    }
}
```

### Use the report ID to retrieve the report data

The standard response includes the report data and a Download URL that you can use to save the data to a file. If you want to get just the Download URL without the report data, pass `"without_data"` in the query string.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=07af1282c9485adcef49c95fa5d7496b'

{
    "response": {

### Use the download URL to save the report data to a file

You use the `"url"` field in the response to save the report data to a file. Simply make another `GET` call and identify the location and file that you want to save to. Be sure to use the file the extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST` request.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=495d03a7667bac467bb488043ae336e9' > /tmp/site_domain.csv
```
