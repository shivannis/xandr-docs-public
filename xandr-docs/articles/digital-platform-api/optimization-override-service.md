# Optimization override service

The Optimization Override service allows clients with sophisticated optimization needs to override a line item's default settings for Discovery, an optimization feature ranks inventory based on its historical CPC and stops your line item from serving on inventory that doesn't perform. Discovery uses a **fail criterion** to cap amount of budget or number of impressions spent before a section of inventory is "axed" (considered failed and removed from eligibility for this line item).

The Optimization Override service allows you to:

- Turn off Discovery.
- Adjust the Discovery fail criteria.

When you set custom fail criteria, these are the rules followed based on the objective you choose for line item optimization preference:

- When **Prefer performance** is selected, Xandr axes inventory at 1x the fail criteria value.
- When **Prefer delivery** is selected, Xandr axes inventory at a dynamic threshold up to 10x the fail criteria value.
- When **Prefer margin** is selected, Xandr axes inventory at 1x the fail criteria.

For more about selecting to prefer performance, delivery, or margin, see [Line Item Service - ALI](./line-item-service---ali.md).

Optimization override can be useful if:

- You're using CPC optimization to value clicks, but do not want to filter the inventory you serve on based on its historical CPC.
- You want to use Discovery, but you want to set a fail criteria at a threshold that's less strict than the line item's CPC goal.
- You want to turn off Discovery altogether and leverage only Xandr click prediction.

## Examples

### View custom discovery settings for a line item

```
curl -X GET -c cookies -b cookies "https://api.appnexus.com/discovery?line_item_id=LINE_ITEM_ID"
 
[
   {
      "id" : 1,
      "member_id" : MEMBER_ID,
      "line_item_id" : LINE_ITEM_ID,
      "discovery_enabled" : true,
      "fail_criteria_amount" : 3
   }
]
```

### Disable discovery

Check to see if a discovery profile exists.

```
$ curl -b cookie "https://api.appnexus.com/discovery?line_item_id=LINE_ITEM_ID"
```

If a profile doesn't exist (a blank is returned instead of a profile), you must create a discovery profile. You can create a discovery profile that is already disabled or disable an existing discovery profile with the same JSON.

```
$ cat discovery.json
{
    "member_id" : MEMBER_ID,
    "line_item_id" : LINE_ITEM_ID,
    "discovery_enabled": false
}

$ curl -X POST -b cookies -d @discovery.json "https://api.appnexus.com/discovery?line_item_id=LINE_ITEM_ID"
```

### Update discovery settings

```
$ cat discovery
{
    "id" : ID_VALUE,
    "member_id" : MEMBER_ID,
    "line_item_id" : LINE_ITEM_ID,
    "discovery_enabled": true,
    "fail_criteria_amount": FAIL_CRITERIA_AMOUNT
}

$ curl -b cookie -X PUT -d @discovery "https://api.appnexus.com/discovery?line_item_id=LINE_ITEM_ID"
```
