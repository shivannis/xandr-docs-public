# Digital Platform API - Member service

A member is any entity that has a financial relationship with Xandr, and each client is a single member. Members are registered with the Member Service by Xandr personnel, and all API activity must be associated with a member. Note that the Member Service does not grant API or UI access. Each member has multiple users who have their own UI and API credentials, and are managed by the [User Service](./user-service.md).

**Members and Contracts**
<br>Before they can buy or sell ads, a member needs a contract with Xandr. This contract will establish financial terms and credit facilities (if applicable), and bind the member to the terms and conditions of Xandr, such as content quality and use of personally identifiable information.
