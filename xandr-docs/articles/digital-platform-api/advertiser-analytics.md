# Advertiser analytics

The Advertiser Analytics report can be used to view performance, revenue, and profit data across a specific advertiser's creatives and campaigns. This report is available to network and advertiser users.

For instructions on retrieving a report, please see [Report Service](./report-service.md) or the [example](#examples) below. This report requires specifying the advertiser ID as part of the URL, for example:

```
https://api.appnexus.com/report?advertiser_id=ADVERTISER_ID
```

## Time frame

The `report_interval` field in the JSON request can be set to one of the following:

- current_hour
- last_hour
- today
- yesterday
- last_48_hours
- last_2_days
- last_7_days
- last_30_days
- month_to_date
- month_to_yesterday
- quarter_to_date
- last_month
- lifetime

**Data retention period**

Most data in this report is maintained permanently (exceptions noted below). After:

- 100 days, you are no longer able to report on hourly data. However, daily, monthly and cumulative intervals are still available.
- 14 months, you are no longer able to report on individual:
  - Creatives
  - Placements
  - Brands

In some cases Analytics reports can show delivery that does not match statistics shown elsewhere in Microsoft Invest or Microsoft Monetize for a given advertiser or publisher. This is due to the way that Analytics reporting data older than 100 days and 14 months are aggregated. The data from Billing reports are kept in non-aggregated form indefinitely. For more information, see [Dates and Times in Reporting](../invest/dates-and-times-in-reporting.md) in the UI documentation.

> [!NOTE]
> To run a report for a custom time frame, set the `start_date` and `end_date` fields in your report request. For more details about these fields, see [Report Service](./report-service.md).

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and report ID in the url field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592' > /tmp/advertiser_analytics.csv 
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
