## Examples

### Create the JSON report request

```
$ cat insertion_order_frequency  {
    "report":{
        "report_type":"insertion_order_frequency",
        "columns":[
            "hour",
            "campaign",
            "imps",
            "clicks",
            "total_convs",
            "ctr",
            "convs_rate"
        ],
        "report_interval":"last_48_hours",
        "format":"csv"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the Report service

`POST` the JSON request to get back a `report_ID`.

```
$ curl -b cookies -X post -d @insertion_order_frequency "https://api.appnexus.com/report"
 
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"09b6979a6a4c3805bdac8921378d3622"
   }
}
```

Alternatively, you can get a `report_id` via a `POST` request using a `saved_report_id`.

```
curl -b cookies -X POST 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?saved_report_id=30'
```

### `GET` the report status from the Report service

Make a `GET` call with the `report_id` to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then, use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=09b6979a6a4c3805bdac8921378d3622'

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report":{
         "name":null,
         "created_on":"2010-05-25 19:15:48",
         "json_request":"{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"insertion_order_frequency\",\"columns\":
          [\"hour\",\"campaign\",\"imps\",\"clicks\",\"total_convs\",
          \"ctr\",\"convs_rate\"],\"row_per\":[\"hour\",\"campaign_id\"],
          \"report_interval\":\"last_48_hours\",\"filters\":[{\"advertiser_id\":\"690\"}]}}",
         "url":"report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592"
      },
      "execution_status":"ready"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the Report Download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the report ID, but this time to the `report-download` service. You can find the service and report ID in the `"url"` field of the response to your previous `GET` call. When setting the file to which you want to save the report, use the file extension of the `"format"` (e.g., .csv) that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!NOTE]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `\-i` or `\-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
curl -b cookies 'http://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592' -o /tmp/insertion_order_frequency.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
