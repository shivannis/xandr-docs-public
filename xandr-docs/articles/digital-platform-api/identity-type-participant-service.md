# Identity Type Participant service

> [!NOTE]
> This service currently is in Alpha. It is still under development and may be subject to change without notice. Contact your Xandr Account Representative to get enabled.

The Identity Type Participant service in Identity Management Framework allows identity framework participants to manage permissions for all identity solutions that they are leveraging. With the Identity Type Participant service, each publisher participant can:

- Choose the external bidder(s) permitted to access their identifier.
- Determine the partner(s) on the platform that are entitled to receive the identifier's value within their log data feeds.

## JSON fields

### Registration fields for Identity Type Participant

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|

| `participant_member_id` | int | The member ID to which the identity type participant belong.<br>**Required On:** `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`. |

### Control settings for an Identity Type Participant service

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `external_bidder_control` | object | Setting that enables sending of identifiers to the external bidders and specifies the eligible ones. For more information, see [External Bidder Control](#external-bidder-control) below. |
| `lld_exposure_control` | object | Setting that configures if the identifier can be utilized in log-level data (LLD) and determine the authorized recipients. For more information, see [Log Level Data Exposure Control](#log-level-data-exposure-control) below. |

### External bidder control

The master setting to control if the identifier can be sent to the external bidders and specifies the eligible external bidders. This field defines default list of bidders who will be receiving the newly registered source and identifier. By default, member participants can use the bidders defined at the identifier level.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|

| `external_bidder_list` | array of integers | List of `member_id` enabled for: `“include_subset”`.  |

### Log-level data exposure control

The participant setting to regulate if the identifier can be utilized in log-level data (LLD) and determine the authorized recipients. This field defines the list of members who will be able to see actual ID values in LLD feed for the newly registered source and identifier. By default, member participants can use the members defined at the identifier level.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `lld_exposure_allowed` | string  | Members enabled to receive identifier values in LLD. <br>Options:<br> - `“use_master_settings”`<br>- `“none”`<br> - `“include_subset”` |
| `exposure_member_list` | array of integers | List of `member_id` enabled for: `“include_subset”`.  |
