            "hour",
            "buyer_member",
            "sold_network_rpm"
        ],
        "report_interval":"last_48_hours",
        "format":"csv"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the reporting service

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X post -d @video_analytics_network_publisher "https://api.appnexus.com/report?publisher_id=4642"
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"f4ebb93755dd01dde4fc157f86198ea9"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service

Make a `GET` call with the Report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies "https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=f4ebb93755dd01dde4fc157f86198ea9"
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report":{
         "name":null,
         "created_on":"2010-05-25 19:37:31",
         "json_request":"{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"video_analytics_network_publisher\",\"columns\":[\"hour\",\"buyer_member\",\"brand_name\",
            \"deal_name\",\"deal_id\",\"imps_sold\",\"video_errors\",\"total_convs\",\"served\"],
            \"row_per\":[\"hour\",\"buyer_member\",\"sold_network_rpm\"],\"report_interval\":\"last_48_hours\",
            \"filters\":[{\"publisher_id\":\"4642\"}]}}",
         "url":"report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592"
      },
      "execution_status":"ready"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the Report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and Report ID in the `url` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!NOTE]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592' > /tmp/video_analytics_network_publisher.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
