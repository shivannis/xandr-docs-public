## Example

### Create JSON formatted report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` of `"video_indemo_audience_profile"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the `"format"` in which the data should be returned (`"csv"`, `"excel"`, or `"html"`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md).

```
$ cat video_indemo_audience_profile
  {
    "report":
    {
        "report_type":"video_indemo_audience_profile",
        "columns":[
            "nielsen_campaign_ref",
            "line_item",
            "line_item.name",
            "start_agg_date",
            "audience_reach",
            "audience_index",
            "grp",
            "demographic_group",
            "total_imps",
            "on_target_imps"
        ],
        "report_interval":"last_7_days",
        "format":"csv"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the reporting service

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @video_indemo_audience_profile 'https://api.appnexus.com/report'
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"097f59fc3ab7d02c5d60db42081d9b69"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service

Make a `GET` call with the Report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=097f59fc3ab7d02c5d60db42081d9b69'
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report":{
         "name":null,
         "created_on":"2021-05-25 19:19:53",
         "json_request":"{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"video_indemo_audience_profile\",\"columns\":[\"nielsen_campaign_ref\",
            \"line_item\",\"line_item.name\",\"start_agg_date\",\"audience_reach\",\"audience_reach_index\",\"grp\",\"demographic_group\",\"total_imps\",\"on_target_imps\"],
            \"report_interval\":\"last_7_days\"}}",
         "url": "report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592"
      },
      "execution_status":"ready"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the Report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and Report ID in the `url` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!NOTE]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592' > /tmp/video_indemo_audience_profile.csv
```
