# Network advertiser analytics

The **Network Advertiser Analytics** report is used to view performance data for a specific advertiser that is more detailed than the data provided in the [Network Analytics](./network-analytics.md) report. This report is available to network users only. Advertiser users can use the [Advertiser Analytics](./advertiser-analytics.md) report.

> [!NOTE]
> For usage instructions, see below. Note that this report requires that an advertiser ID be specified as part of the URL, for example:
>
> ```
> https://api.appnexus.com/report?advertiser_id=ADVERTISER_ID
> ```

## Time frame

The `report_interval` field in the JSON request can be set to one of the following:

- current_hour
- last_hour
- today
- yesterday
- last_48_hours
- last_2_days
- last_7_days
- last_30_days
- month_to_date
- month_to_yesterday
- quarter_to_date
- last_month
- lifetime

> [!NOTE]
> To run a report for a custom time frame, set the `start_date` and `end_date` fields in your report request. For more details about these fields, see [Report Service](./report-service.md).

**Data retention period**

Most data in this report is maintained permanently (exceptions noted below). After:

- 100 days, you are no longer able to report on hourly data. However, daily, monthly and cumulative intervals are still available.
- 14 months, you are no longer able to report on individual:
  - Creatives
  - Placements
  - Brands

In some cases Analytics reports can show delivery that does not match statistics shown elsewhere in Invest or Monetizes for a given advertiser or publisher. This is due to the way that Analytics reporting data older than 100 days and 14 months are aggregated. The data from Billing reports are kept in non-aggregated form indefinitely.

## Dimensions

## Example

### Create JSON report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` of `"network_advertiser_analytics"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the format in which the data should be returned (`csv`, `excel`, or `html`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md).

```
$ cat network_advertiser_analytics

{"report":
    {
        "report_type":"network_advertiser_analytics",
        "columns":[
            "hour",
            "seller_member_id",
            "campaign_id",
            "imps",
            "clicks",
            "total_convs",
            "ctr",
            "convs_rate"
        ],
        "report_interval":"last_48_hours",
        "format":"csv"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the [Report Service](./report-service.md)

You `POST` the JSON request and get back a report ID.

```
$ curl -b cookies -X post -d @network_advertiser_analytics "https://api.appnexus.com/report?advertiser_id=690"

{
  "response":{
   "status":"OK",
   "report_id":"09b6979a6a4c3805bdac8921378d3622"
  }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service

Make a  `GET` call with the report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the reporting data to a file (described in the next step).

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=09b6979a6a4c3805bdac8921378d3622'

{
  "response":{
   "status":"OK",
   "report":{
     "name":null,
     "created_on":"2010-05-25 19:15:48",
     "json_request":"{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"network_advertiser_analytics\",\"columns\":
     [\"hour\",\"seller_member_id\",\"campaign_id\",\"imps\",\"clicks\",\"total_convs\",
     \"ctr\",\"convs_rate\"],\"row_per\":[\"hour\",\"seller_member_id\",\"campaign_id\"],
     \"report_interval\":\"last_48_hours\",\"filters\":[{\"advertiser_id\":\"690\"}]}}",
     "url":"report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592"
   },
   "execution_status":"ready"
  }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and report ID in the `url` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!NOTE]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592' > /tmp/network_advertiser_analytics.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
