# Line Item service - ALI

> [!NOTE]
> This page describes the Line Item Service for augmented line items. It links to other API documentation that is designed for legacy line items and may mention fields and objects that are not used with augmented line items. Most importantly, augmented line items can only be used with seamless insertion orders, not legacy insertion orders, which don't support budget intervals (i.e., don't use the `budget_intervals` array).
>
> To create an augmented line item, you must set the `line_item_type` field to `'standard_v2'` and associate the line item with a seamless insertion order via the `insertion_orders` array.

A line item defines your financial relationship with an advertiser, including budget, revenue type, performance goals, bidding strategies, and inventory targeting. The augmented line item must be used with the seamless insertion order. We suggest that you streamline your setup for long-standing advertiser relationships by adding budget intervals to your insertion orders.

> [!NOTE]
> **About Performance Goals**
>
> Goal Pixels are used to track and measure performance when the `revenue_type` and the `goal_type` are not measured the same way. For example, a `revenue_type` of `"cpm"` might be matched with a `goal_type` of `"cpa"` because the advertiser wants to measure goal achievement in terms of conversions but pay in CPM.
>
> - **CPA**: To set performance goals for line items with `goal_type` `"cpa"`, use both the [Goal Pixels](#goal-pixels) array of objects and the [Valuation](#valuation) object below. The `goal_pixels` array contains information about CPA goal targets and thresholds. See **CPC** below for a basic explanation of the `valuation` object.
> - **CPC**: To set performance goals for line items with the `goal_type` `"cpc"`, use the `valuation` object. The `valuation` object contains the performance goal threshold, which determines the bid/no bid cutoff on optimized line items, and the performance goal target, which represents the desired clicks or click-through rate. For more details on which fields to set, see the description of the `valuation` object below.
>
> **About Geography Targeting**
>
> For Augmented Line Item, it is mandatory to set at least one country as geography targeting. To add geography targeting, see **Country Targets** under **Targeting** section in the **[Profile Service](profile-service.md)** page.

| `code` | string (100) | A custom code for the line item. The code may only contain alphanumeric characters, periods, underscores or dashes. The code you enter is not case-sensitive (upper- and lower-case characters are treated the same). No 2 objects at the same level (e.g., insertion orders or line items) can use the same code per advertiser. For example, 2 line items cannot both use code "XYZ", but a single insertion order and its child line item can.<br>**Default:** `null` |
| `name` | string (255) | The name of the line item.<br>**Required On:** `POST` |
| `advertiser_id` | int | The ID of the advertiser to which the line item belongs. |
| `state` | enum | The state of the line item. Possible values: `"active"` or `"inactive"`.<br>**Default:** `"active"` |

| `end_date` | timestamp | Do not use this field. Instead, use the `start_date` and `end_date` fields within the `budget_intervals` array to designate when the line item should run.<br>**Default:** `null` (indefinitely) |
| `timezone` | enum | The timezone by which budget and spend are counted. For details and accepted values, see [API Timezones](api-timezones.md).<br><br>**Note:**<br>For ALIs, be sure to use this field (and not the one in the `budget_intervals` array) to set the line item's time zone.<br>**Default:** `"UTC"` or advertiser's timezone. |
| `ad_types` | array of strings | The type of creative used for this line item. Possible values:<br>- `"banner"`<br>- `"video"`<br>- `"native"`<br>- `"audio"`<br><br>The array should only have a single value. This value determines how auction items are tracked for the line item's buying strategy, paying strategy, optimization options, creative association, and targeting options.<br><br>**Note:**<br>All creatives associated to a line item must have the same ad type, which should match the `ad_types` selected here.<br>**Default:** `"banner"`<br>**Required On:** `POST`/`PUT` |
| `discrepancy_pct` | double | **Deprecated.** |
| `publishers_allowed` | string | **Deprecated.** Use the values of the `supply_strategies` array to set the supply types (e.g., RTB/Open Exchange, Deals, Managed). |
| `revenue_value` | double | The amount paid to the network by the advertiser.<br><br>**Note:** Depending on what you set the `revenue_type` field to, this field must be set to the actual value of that revenue type (e.g., the desired CPC). If your `revenue_type` is `"cost_plus_margin"`, set this field to the percentage margin your client pays you (e.g., `.20` for 20%).<br>**Required On:** `POST`/`PUT` |
| `revenue_type` | enum | The way the advertiser has agreed to pay you (also called Booked Revenue). Possible values are listed below.<br>- `"cpm"`: Select this value if you are being paid flat payment for 1000 impressions (CPM), per click (CPC) or per view (Viewable CPM):<br>&nbsp; - If CPM, set this to `"cpm"`, the `revenue_value` field to the CPM value and set the `max_avg_cpm` and `min_avg_cpm` fields to `null`.<br>&nbsp; - If CPC, set this to `"cpm"`, the `revenue_value` field to the CPC value and set `"revenue_auction_event_type"` to `"click"`, `"revenue_auction_event_type_code"` to `"click"`, and `"revenue_auction_type_id"` to `3`.<br>&nbsp; - If Viewable CPM, set this to `"cpm"`, the `revenue_value` field to the Viewable CPM value, the `revenue_auction_event_type` field to `"view"`, the `revenue_auction_event_type_code` field to `"view_display_50pv1s_an"`, and `"revenue_auction_type_id"` to `2`.

If `"vcpm"` is selected here, `goal_type` has been set to `'none'`, and no `'expected_value'` model has been attached, you must set a `'max_avg_cpm'` value.<br><br>**Note:**<br>If `programmatic_guaranteed` (in `supply_strategies`) is set to `true`, `revenue_type` must be set to `cost_plus_margin` or `cost_plus_cpm`.<br> - `"cost_plus_margin"`: Media cost (what you spend on inventory) plus a percentage of what you spend. If selected, you must also set the `revenue_value` to a percentage margin you receive (e.g., `.2` for 20%). Data costs will also be added if you participate in third-party data clearing (e.g., segments). If you disable optimization for Cost Plus (via the `goal_type` field), you must set a flat CPM for Cost Plus via the `max_avg_cpm` field (in the `valuation` object).<br>- `"cost_plus_cpm"`: Media cost (what you spend on inventory) plus a service fee that you charge the advertiser based on CPM revenue. If selected, you must also set the `revenue_value` to a flat CPM margin you receive (e.g., `1` for a $1 CPM). Data costs will also be added if you participate in third-party data clearing (e.g., segments). If you disable optimization for Cost Plus (via the `goal_type` field), you must set a flat CPM for Cost Plus via the `max_avg_cpm` field (in the `valuation` object).<br><br>**Note:**<br>If the `lifetime_budget_imps` or `daily_budget_imps` fields are set or the line item's parent insertion order's `budget_type` is set to `impression`, then `revenue_type` may not be set to `"CPC"`.<br>**Default:** `"none"` |
| `goal_type` | enum | For line items that make use of performance goals. Possible values: `null`, `"cpc"`, `"cpa"`, `"ctr"`, or `"custom"`.<br> - If you want to optimize to a CPA performance goal for both post-click and post-view conversions, set this field to `"cpa"`. You must also set the `post_click_goal_threshold` and `post_videw_goal_threshold` fields (in the `goal_pixels` array of objects) to your CPA goal. These values must be the same, since Xandr will optimize to one value. Additionally, you must set `campaign_group_valuation_strategy` to "`retargeting"` or `"prospecting"`. For details, see `campaign_valuation_strategy` in [Valuation](#valuation) below.<br>- If you want to optimize to a CPA performance goal for only post-click conversions, set this field to `"cpa"`. You must also set the `post_click_goal_target` and `post_click_goal_threshold` fields (in the `goal_pixels` array of objects) to your CPA goal.<br> - If you want to optimize to a CPC goal, set this field to `"cpc"`. You must also set the `goal_target` and `goal_threshold` fields (in the `valuation` object) to your CPC goal and set `goal_pixel` to `null`.<br> - If you want to optimize to a Viewable CPM goal, set this field to `null`. You must also set the `goal_target` and `goal_threshold` fields (in the valuation object) and `goal_pixels` to `null`. In addition, you must also set the following fields in the `auction_event` object: `kpi_auction_event_type`, `kpi_auction_event_type_code`, `kpi_auction_type_id`, and `kpi_value`.<br>- If you want to optimize to a CTR goal, set this field to `"ctr"`. In addition, you must also set the `goal_target` and the `goal_threshold` in the `valuation` object to the desired clickthrough rate (a decimal value between `0` and `1`).<br> - If you want to upload your own custom EV model (Expected Valuation), as opposed to a `click_imp` or `ev_click` model, set this field to `"custom"`. For details, see [Custom Models](../data-science-toolkit/custom-models.md).<br>- If you want to disable optimization, set this field to `null`. In addition, for `PUT` calls, if the line item was previously set to optimize to a Viewable CPM, you must also set the following fields (in the `auction_event` object) as follows:<br>&nbsp; - `"kpi_auction_event_type"`: `"impression"`<br>&nbsp; - `"kpi_auction_event_type_code"`: `"impression"`<br>&nbsp; - `"kpi_auction_type_id"`: `1`<br>&nbsp; - `"kpi_value"`: `null`<br><br>**Default:** `"none"` |
| `goal_value` | double | **Deprecated.** Use `valuation` object instead. For details, see [Valuation](#valuation) below. |

For a list of supported currencies, see the [Currency Service](currency-service.md).<br><br>**Note:**<br>Once the line item has been created, the currency cannot be changed.<br><br>**Tip:**<br>As a best practice, align currency to the billing currency in order to achieve the best possible local currency experience.<br><br>**Default:** Default currency of the advertiser. |
| `require_cookie_for_tracking` | boolean | Indicates whether or not you want to serve only to users who use cookies for conversion-tracking purposes (because Xandr conversion attribution is cookie-based). If set to `true`, this indicates that you won't serve to non-cookie users because they have no potential for conversion attribution. If set to `false`, this indicates that you'll serve to non-cookie users and accept no conversion attribution for those users. This field's setting is only relevant when a conversion pixel has been applied, so setting this to `true` won't require cookies for a line item that has no conversion pixels.<br>- If `true`, a cookie is required for conversion tracking.<br>- If `programmatic_guaranteed` (in `supply_strategies`) is set to `true`, `require_cookie_for_tracking` must be set to `false`.<br><br>**Default:** `true` |
| `profile_id` | int | You may associate an optional `profile_id` with this line item. A profile is a generic set of rules for targeting inventory. For details, see the [Profile Service](profile-service.md). |
| `member_id` | int | ID of the member that owns the line item. |
| `comments` | string | Comments about the line item. |

| `advertiser` | object | An object describing the advertiser with which this line item is associated. For details, see [Advertiser](#advertiser) below.<br><br>**Read Only.** |
| `labels` | array | The optional labels applied to the line item. Currently, the labels available are: `"Trafficker"` and `"Sales Rep"`. For more details, see [Labels](#labels) below.<br><br>**Note:**<br>You can report on line item labels with the [Network Analytics](network-analytics.md) and [Network Advertiser Analytics](./network-advertiser-analytics.md) reports. For example, if you use the `"Trafficker"` label to specify the name of the trafficker responsible for each line item, you could run the Network Analytics report filtered by `"trafficker_for_line_item"` to focus on the line items that a particular trafficker is responsible for, or grouped by `"trafficker_for_line_item"` to rank the performance of your traffickers. |
| `broker_fees` | array | **Deprecated.** Use `partner_fees` instead. |
| `pixels` | array of objects | The conversion pixels used to track CPA revenue. Both post-click and post-view revenue may be specified. You may only attach 20 pixels to a line item.

Possible values: `"real_time"`, `"direct"`, or `"both"`. `"Real-time"` includes all third-party inventory not managed by your network that has been enabled for reselling (including external supply partners such as Microsoft Advertising Exchange and Google Ad Manager). `"Direct"` includes only inventory managed by your network.<br><br>**Note:** Although you can continue to use this field, the fields within `supply_strategies` object are the preferred mechanism for designating inventory supply sources. However, once you set any of the boolean fields within `supply_strategies` object to `true`, the value of the `inventory_type` field will be permanently ignored and unsettable for that augmented line item.<br>**Default:** `"real_time"` |
| `supply_strategies` | object | An object containing several boolean fields used to designate which inventory supply sources you would like to target. The values of this object's boolean fields supersede the setting of the `inventory_type` field and once set will cause the `inventory_type` field to be permanently locked and ignored. For more details, see [Supply Strategies](#supply-strategies) below. |
| `creative_distribution_type` | enum | When multiple creatives of the same size are trafficked via a line item, this field's setting is used to determine the creative rotation strategy that will be used. Allowed values:<br> - `even`: Even rotation is handled automatically by our system. Also select this if you want creative rotation to be handled at the splits level.<br> - `weighted`: Creative rotation is based on a user-supplied weight.<br> - `ctr-optimized`: The creative in the size bucket with the highest CTR delivers the most.<br>**Default:** `null`<br><br>**Note:** If a specific `creative_distribution_type` is not passed through the API (`null` value is passed), then value of `creative_distribution_type` is set to `even`. |
| `prefer_delivery_over_performance` | boolean | This field is used to indicate your goal priority (whether you wish to give greater priority to delivery, performance, or margin). Options are:<br>- `true`: This option (delivery) prioritizes impression volume by multiplying bids up to 2x in response to delivery. When you optimize to clicks, it also allows line items to discover inventory with historical CPCs up to 10x the goal.<br><br>**Warning:**<br>This may cause margin and performance to be deprioritized, possibly resulting in a negative margin.<br><br>- `false`: Select this option to do one of the following:<br>&nbsp; - Prioritize performance (e.g., clicks). This prioritizes your advertiser goal over impression volume and profit. If you select this option, you must also set `min_margin_pct` (in the `valuation` object) to `null`.<br>&nbsp; - Prioritize margin. This reduces optimized bids by your desired profit margin. Additional margin may be earned through Adaptive Pacing if your revenue type is CPM, Dynamic CPM, Viewable CPM, or CPC. If you select this option, you must also set the `min_margin_pct` field (in the `valuation` object) to your desired margin (e.g. `10` for 10%)<br>**Default:** `false` |
| `use_ip_tracking` | boolean | Determines whether IP Attribution is enabled or not for a given line item. |
| `viewability_vendor` | string | This field determines what provider measures the viewability of the ad unit. The only value that is currently valid is `"appnexus"`.<br>**Default:** `"appnexus"` |
| `is_archived` | boolean | **Read-only.** Indicates whether the line item has been automatically archived due to not being used. Once set to `true`, the value can't be changed and the only calls that can be made on the line item object are `GET` and `DELETE`.<br><br>**Note:**<br>If a line item is automatically archived, its profile will also be archived and the only calls that may be made on either of those objects are `GET` and `DELETE`. In addition, once archived, the line item may not be associated with any insertion orders.<br>**Default:** `false` |
| `archived_on` | timestamp | The date and time on which the line item was archived (i.e., when the `is_archived` field was set to `true`).<br>**Default:** `null`<br>**Read Only.** |
| `partner_fees` | Array | An array of partner fees applied to this line item. You can create or view third-party partner fees with the [Partner Fee Service](partner-fee-service.md). For more details, see [Partner Fees](#partner-fees) below. |
| `line_item_subtype` | enum | The subtype of the line item. The `line_item_subtype` field cannot be changed after the line item is created. For Invest buyers, the supported values are as follows:<br> - `standard_buying`: Augmented line item eligible to serve on managed, RTB, or deals. Omitting the line_item_subtype on `POST` requests will default to this subtype behaviour.<br>- `pg_buying`: Eligible only to transact on PG deals. If the subtype is passed on the `POST`, the `line_item_type`, `bid_object_type`, `delivery_model_type`, and `supply_strategies` fields are not required.<br>- `standard_curated`: For curated deal line items. For more details, see `line_item_subtype` in [Curated Deal Line Item API Setup Guide](curated-deal-line-item-api-setup-guide.md).<br><br>**Default:** `standard_buying` |

### Budgeting/pricing

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `lifetime_budget` | double | The lifetime budget in dollars (media cost). `Null` corresponds to `"unlimited"`.<br><br>**Warning:**<br>If `lifetime_budget` is set to `null` (unlimited), and the line item and insertion order lifetime budgets are also set to `null`, severe overspend can occur.<br><br>**Default:** `null` |
| `lifetime_budget_imps` | int | The lifetime budget in impressions. `Null` corresponds to `"unlimited"`.<br>**Default:** `null` |

### Supply strategies

The `supply_strategies` object is used to designate which supply source you wish to target when buying inventory. You can target any combination of the `rtb` (Open Exchange), `managed`, or `deals` fields by setting each to `true` or `false`. If you are targeting a programmatic guaranteed deal, set the `programmatic_guaranteed` field to `true` and the `rtb`, `managed`, and `deals` fields to `false`. At least one of these `supply_strategies` object fields must be set to `true`.

> [!NOTE]
> For deals, in addition setting the `deals` field to `true` within this object, you must also ensure that you both provide a list of deals to target or exclude in the `deal_targets` array and set the `deal_action_include` field to `true` or `false` (depending on inclusion or exclusion) in the [Profile Service](profile-service.md).
> [!WARNING]
> The values of this object's boolean fields supersede the setting of the `inventory_type` field. Once any of these fields are set to `true` on an ALI, the `inventory_type` field will be ignored and unsettable for that line item. If you attempt to make a `PUT` call on the value of the `inventory_type` field after one or more of these fields have been set to `true` , the following error message will be generated: `"inventory_type cannot be updated once supply_strategies has been set"`.
> [!NOTE]
> The Line Item API Service supports Roadblocks only if the `supply_strategy` is `managed`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `rtb` | boolean | Designates whether you wish to target inventory on the Open Exchange. This includes all third-party inventory not managed by your network that has been enabled for reselling (including external supply partners such as Microsoft Advertising Exchange and Google Ad Manager). |
| `managed` | boolean | Designates whether you wish to target managed inventory. This only includes inventory managed by your network. |
| `deals` | boolean | Designates whether you wish to target deal inventory. This includes any deals which you are are eligible to bid on. |
| `programmatic_guaranteed` | boolean | Designates whether you wish to target a programmatic guaranteed deal with this line item. If this is set to `true`, then the `rtb`, `managed`, and `deals` fields must be set to `false`. |

**Target open exchange and 2 deals but *not* managed inventory**

### Broker fees

Broker fees are deprecated for augmented line items. Please create partner fees and apply them to the line item using the [Partner Fee Service](partner-fee-service.md).

### Partner fees

If you need to reserve a portion of your budget for third-party costs--costs owed to parties other than the publisher--you can define
this information with the [Partner Fee Service](partner-fee-service.md). Fees can be tracked on a CPM, cost share, or revenue share basis, and can be applied to multiple advertisers and line items, if desired. A single advertiser or line item can have multiple fees applied.

The `partner fee` array includes the following field:

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `id` | int | The ID of a partner fee applied to this line item. |

**Apply a fee to a line item**

### Valuation

The valuation object is used to set performance goals for line items with the `goal_type` of `"cpc"` or `"cpa"`. It contains the performance goal threshold, which determines the bid/no bid cutoff on optimized line items, and the performance goal target, which represents the desired clicks or conversions.

The `valuation` object contains the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `min_margin_pct` | decimal | Only set this field if you have set `prefer_delivery_over_performance` to `false` and `revenue_type` has not been set to `cost_plus_margin`. Set this to your desired minimum margin (e.g., `10` for 10%). This may cause your delivery and performance to be deprioritized.<br>**Default:** `null` |
| `goal_threshold` | decimal | The performance goal threshold determines bidding, inventory discovery, and the bid/no bid check on optimized line items. A value is required here when you are optimizing to a CTR or CPC goal, or a CPA goal for only post-click conversions.<br> - If you are optimizing to a CTR, enter the desired clickthrough rate (a value between 0 and 1).<br>If you are optimizing to a CPC goal, enter your CPC goal.<br> - If you are optimizing to a CPA goal for only post-click conversions, enter your CPC goal (**not** your CPA goal), and set the `post_click_goal_task` and `post_click_goal_threshold` fields in the `goal_pixels` array of objects.<br><br>**Note:**<br> - If you are optimizing to a CPA goal with both post-click and post-view conversions, see [Goal Pixels](#goal-pixels) below for required settings.<br>**Default:** `null` |
| `goal_target` | decimal | The performance goal target is a required value when you are optimizing to a CTR, CPC goal, CPA goal (for only post-click conversions), or Viewable CPM goal.<br> - If you are optimizing to a CTR, enter the desired clickthrough rate (a value between `0` and `1`).<br>- If you are optimizing to a CPC goal, enter your CPC goal.<br>- If you are optimizing to a CPA goal for only post-click conversions, enter your CPC goal (**not** your CPA goal), and set the `post_click_goal_target` and `post_click_goal_threshold` fields in the `goal_pixels` array of objects.<br>- If you are optimizing to a Viewable CPM, set this field to `null`. |
| `campaign_group_valuation_strategy` | enum | Determines whether a line item that has a CPA goal for both post-click and post-view conversions is optimized for retargeting or prospecting.<br> - Set to `"retargeting"` for a retargeting line item (a line item that aims to drive users who have already shown interest in the brand further down a conversion funnel). The line item profile must target at least one segment that is not in the data marketplace. Use the [Profile Service](profile-service.md) to set up segment targeting.<br>- Set to `"prospecting"` for a prospecting line item (a line item that aims to drive new users into a conversion funnel). |
| `min_avg_cpm` | double | The value below which the average CPM may not fall. If the `max_avg_cpm` field is also set, `min_avg_cpm` serves as a lower bound of a range. You must set this field if you set `revenue_type` to `"vcpm"` (Dynamic CPM) or `"cost_plus_margin"`. If you set `revenue_type` to `"cpm"`, you must set this field to `null`. |
| `max_avg_cpm` | double | The value above which the average CPM may not rise. If the `min_avg_cpm` field is also set, `max_avg_cpm` serves as a upper bound of a range. You must set this field if you set `revenue_type` to `"vcpm"` or `"cost_plus_margin"` If you set `revenue_type` to `"cpm"`, you must set this field to `null`.<br><br>If you have disabled optimization for Cost Plus (via the `goal_type` field), you must set a flat CPM for Cost Plus. Use this field to set the flat CPM value. |
| `min_margin_cpm` | double | Margin Value when Margin Type is CPM. <br><br>**Note:** The `min_margin_cpm` and `min_margin_pct` fields cannot both be set at the same time. If one is set, the other must be `null`. Xandr validates customer entitlements when clients use these fields.<br>**Default:** `null` |
| `min_margin_pct` | double | Margin Value when Margin Type is Percentage. <br><br>**Note:** The `min_margin_cpm` and `min_margin_pct` fields cannot both be set at the same time. If one is set, the other must be `null`. Xandr validates customer entitlements when clients use these fields.<br>**Default:** `null` |

```

### Demographic attributes

| Key | Type (Length) | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `on_target_goal_pct` | double | Indicates how often you'd like your line item to deliver to your specified demography (such specification is done by inserting values for the keys below). This reference goal percentage is used in reporting and doesn't affect line item performance.<br>Possible values: `1` to `100`. |
| `target_gender` | string | Specifies the gender of the demography that you're trying to target.<br>Possible values: `"all"`, `"male"`, or `"female"`. |
| `target_age_lower` | int | Specifies the age threshold of the demographic age range that you're trying to target.<br>Possible values: `13`, `18`, `21`, `25`, `30`, `35`, `40`, `45`, `50`, `55`, `60`, or `65`. |

### Offline attribution

The `offline_attribution` object enables offline sales attribution for your line item. Offline sales attribution is a **Beta** feature provided by Nielsen Catalina Solutions (NCS), so you'll need to gain **Beta** testing access to this feature prior to using it. To gain access, contact your Xandr account representative.

> [!NOTE]
> To utilize offline sales attribution, your line item must have a targeting configuration that exclusively targets within the United States.

### Budget intervals

Budget intervals on an augmented line item must fall within the budget intervals defined on the line item's parent insertion order(s). Budget intervals on line items should have budgets distinct from those of the parent insertion order(s). These function as line item-specific "sub-budgets" of the budget on the corresponding insertion order budget interval.

When creating a new augmented line item, ensure that the `start_date` and `end_date` of each of its `budget_intervals` array objects fall
within one of the budget intervals defined on the parent insertion order (insertion orders are associated with line items via the
`insertion_orders` array in the Line Item Service).

> [!NOTE]
> The `parent_interval_id` (in the `budget_intervals` array) has been deprecated and its value will be ignored.

Also consider the following when using the `budget_interval` array:

- Budget intervals on the same line item cannot overlap.
- Budget intervals on the line item can have unlimited lifetime budgets (i.e., if all budget fields are left set to `null`).
- Budget intervals cannot be used if budget fields on the top-most level of the `line_item` object (as described in the **General** section of this page) itself are set.
- If you are increasing the budget for the line item's budget interval, you must first increase the budget for the budget interval on the parent insertion order (otherwise you may not have sufficient budget). For more information, see [Insertion Order Service](insertion-order-service.md).
- For optimization to work best, your budget intervals should have a duration of at least 4 hours.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If line item's parent insertion order's `budget_type` field is set to **`impression`** :
>   - The `lifetime_budget` and `daily_budget` fields in this array must be set to `null.`
>   - Use either the `lifetime_budget_imps` or `daily_budget_imps` field in this array to set your line item's budget.
>
> - If the line item's parent insertion order's `budget_type` field is set to **`revenue`** :
>   - The `lifetime_budget_imps` and `daily_budget_imps` fields in this array must be set to `null.`
>   - Use either the `lifetime_budget` or `daily_budget` field in this array to set your line item's budget.

Each object in the `budget_intervals` array contains the following fields.

| Field | Type (Length) | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `id` | int | The ID of the budget interval. |
| `start_date` | timestamp | The start date of the budget interval. Format must be `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss` (hh:mm:ss should be hh:00:00). |
| `end_date` | timestamp | The end date of the budget interval. Format must be `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss` (hh:mm:ss should be set to hh:59:59). For optimization to work best, your budget intervals should have a duration of at least 4 hours. If this field is set to `null`, then the line item's budget interval will run indefinitely. If you set this field to `'null'`:<br>- There may not be more than one object in the `budget_intervals` array (i.e., maximum of 1 budget interval).<br>- The `lifetime_pacing` field must set to `"false"`.<br>- The `"lifetime_budget"` must be set to `null` and the `"daily_budget"` field must be set to a non-null or non-0 value. |
| `timezone` | string | The timezone by which budget and spend are counted. For a list of acceptable timezone values, see [API Timezones](api-timezones.md). |
| `parent_interval_id` | int | **Deprecated.** The value of this field will be ignored. Instead, use the `start_date` and `end_date` fields of this array to define when the line item should run. |
| `lifetime_budget` | double | The lifetime budget in revenue for the budget interval. The revenue currency is defined by the `currency` field on the `insertion_order` object.<br><br>**Note:**<br>If you also set the `lifetime_budget_imps` field in this array, whichever budget is exhausted first will cause spending to stop. Best practice is to only set one of these fields. |
| `lifetime_budget_imps` | double | The lifetime budget in impressions for the budget interval. <br><br>**Note:** If you add line items to this insertion order, any spend already associated with those line items before they are added to the insertion order is NOT counted against the lifetime budget of the insertion order. Only spend that occurs while the line item is a child of the insertion order is counted.<br><br>**Note:**<br>If you also set the `lifetime_budget` field in this array, whichever budget is exhausted first will cause spending to stop. Best practice is to only set one of these fields. |
| `lifetime_pacing` | boolean | If `true`, the line item will attempt to pace the lifetime budget evenly over the budget interval. If `true`, you must set `lifetime_budget` or `lifetime_budget_imps`. |
| `subflights`<br><br>**Note:**<br>Subflights are an **Alpha** feature. If you'd like to gain access to them for your augmented line item, please contact your Xandr account representative. | array of objects | An optional array that contains subflights you can create to further customize your budget interval's budgeting and scheduling behavior. Subflights allow you to set custom budget and pacing settings for specific days within a line item flight.<br>For more information on the `subflights` array of key-value objects, see the [Subflights](#subflights) table below.<br><br>**Note:** Line items can use no more than one subflight for any given date. |
| `daily_budget` | double | The daily budget in revenue for the budget interval. The revenue currency is defined by the `currency` field on the `insertion_order` object. <br><br>**Note:** If you add line items to this insertion order, any impressions associated to those line items when they are added to the insertion order are NOT counted under the lifetime budget of the insertion order. Only impressions that occur while the line item is a child of the insertion order are counted.<br><br>**Note:**<br>If you also set the `daily_budget_imps` field, whichever budget is exhausted first will cause spending to stop. Best practice is to only set one of these fields. |
| `daily_budget_imps` | double | The daily budget in impressions.<br><br>**Note:**<br>If the parent insertion order's `budget_type` field has been set to `"impression"` *and* the line items `revenue_type` field has been set to Viewable CPM, only the viewable impressions count against both line item and insertion order budgets.<br><br>If you also set the `daily_budget` field, whichever budget is exhausted first will cause spending to stop. Best practice is to only set one of these fields. |
| `enable_pacing` | boolean | If `true`, then spending will be paced over the course of the day. Only applicable if there is a `daily_budget`. |
| `creatives` | array | Specifies the creatives associated with this budget interval. In order to serve, creatives must also be specified in the line item `creatives` field and `all_budget_intervals` must be `false`. |

**Delete a budget interval**

> [!NOTE]
> You may remove budget intervals from an augmented line item. However, if you want to remove a budget interval from the parent insertion order, you must first remove any budget intervals (that fall within the parent insertion order's budget interval) from all augmented line items associated with the insertion order. Only then can you remove the budget interval from the insertion order. For more details, see [Insertion Order Service](insertion-order-service.md).

The `goal_pixels` array of objects is used when working with `goal_type` `"cpa"` and contains information about performance goal targets and thresholds. Each object in the `goal_pixels` array of objects includes the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `id` | int | The ID of the conversion pixel. |
| `state` | enum | The state of the pixel. Possible values: `"active"` or `"inactive"`. |
| `post_click_goal` | double | **Deprecated.** Use `post_click_goal_target` and `post_click_goal_threshold` instead. |
| `post_view_goal` | double | **Deprecated.** Use `post_view_goal_target` and `post_view_goal_threshold` instead. |
| `trigger_type` | enum | The type of event required for an attributed conversion. Possible values: `"view"`, `"click"`, or `"hybrid"`.<br>**Read Only.** |
| `post_click_goal_target` | double | The advertiser goal value for post-click conversions for the pixel. If you want to set a CPA goal and optimize to only post-click conversions, set this field to your CPA goal value. |
| `post_view_goal_target` | double | The advertiser goal value for post-view conversions for the pixel (comparable to `goal_value` for `goal_type` `"cpc"`). If you want to set a CPA goal and optimize only to post-view conversions, ensure this field is set to `null`. |
| `post_click_goal_threshold` | double | The advertiser goal threshold for post-click conversions for the pixel. This determines the bid/no bid cutoff on optimized line items. If you want to set a CPA goal and optimize to both post-click and post-view conversions, this field must contain the same value as `post_view_goal_threshold`. |
| `post_view_goal_threshold` | double | The advertiser goal threshold for post-view conversions for the pixel. This determines the bid/no bid cutoff on optimized line items. If you want to set a CPA goal and optimize to both post-click and post-view conversions, this field must contain the same value as `post_click_goal_threshold`. |

### Stats

> [!NOTE]
> The `stats` object has been **deprecated** (as of October 17, 2016). Use the [Report Service](report-service.md) to obtain statistical information instead.

### First run/last run

To include the `first_run` and `last_run` fields in a `GET` response, pass `flight_info=true` in the query string. You can also filter for line items based on when they first and last served, as follows:

**Retrieve only line items that have never served**

Pass `never_run=true` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&never_run=true'
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can use `never_run=true` in combination with other filters, but please note that it will always be an OR relationship. For example, if you pass both `never_run=true` and `min_first_run=2012-01-01 00:00:00` in the query string, you will be looking for line items that have never served OR line items that first served on or after 2012-01-01.

**Retrieve only line items that first served on or after a specific date**

Pass `min_first_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&min_first_run=2012-01-01 00:00:00'
```

**Retrieve only line items that first served on or before a specific date**

Pass `max_first_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&max_first_run=2012-08-01 00:00:00'
```

**Retrieve only line items that first served within a specific date range**

Pass `min_first_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS&max_first_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&min_first_run=2012-01-01 00:00:00&max_first_run=2012-08-01 00:00:00'
```

**Retrieve only line items that last served on or after a specific date**

Pass `min_last_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&min_last_run=2012-01-01 00:00:00'
```

**Retrieve only line items that last served on or before a specific date**

Pass `max_last_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&max_last_run=2012-08-01 00:00:00'
```

**Retrieve only line items that last served within a specific date range**

Pass `min_last_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS&max_last_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&min_last_run=2012-01-01 00:00:00&max_last_run=2012-08-01 00:00:00'
```

Fields of the type date can be filtered by `nmin` and `nmax` as well. The `nmin` filter lets you find dates that are either `null` or after the specified date, and the `nmax` filter lets you find dates that are either `null` or before the specified date.

### Alerts

This field notifies you of conditions that are preventing the line item from serving. There are two types of alerts: pauses and warnings. Pauses are considered intentional and user-driven, whereas warnings are considered unintentional.

To retrieve line items based on pauses, you must pass certain query string parameters in the `GET` request. See below for use cases with query string parameters and examples.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use these query string parameters both when retrieving all line items or specific line items, but the examples below only cover retrieving all line items, as that is where this feature offers the most value.

**Retrieve all line items and show alerts**

Pass `show_alerts=true` in the query string. This parameter will add the `alerts` object to every line item in the response, whether or not the line item has pauses.

> [!NOTE]
> For each of the use cases below, you must pass `show_alerts=true` if you want the `alerts` object to show up in the response.

**Retrieve only line items that have two or more specific pauses**

Pass `show_alerts=true&pauses=SUM_OF_PAUSE_IDS` in the query string. For pause IDs, see the [Pauses](#pauses) table below.

In this example, we add together pause ID `1` and pause ID `2` to retrieve all line items that are set to inactive and have a flight state date in the future.

## Examples

### Update a line item to use a CPC performance goal

In this example, we'll update a line item to use a CPC performance goal. We're setting a cost-per-click goal threshold of $3.

```
$ cat line-item
{
    "line-item": {
    "name": "Weekday French Speakers Q3 2012",
    "state": "inactive",
    "comments": "The name says it all -- that's who we're trying to advertise to",
    "daily_budget": null,
    "revenue_type": "cpm",
    "goal_type": "cpc",

    "lifetime_budget": null,
    "end_date": null,
    "enable_pacing": null,

}
```

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies -X PUT -d @line-item "https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?id=152083&advertiser_id=51"
```

### Update a line item to use both a CPC and CPA performance goal

In this example, we'll update a line item to use both a CPC and CPA performance goal. We're setting the CPC goal of $5 and the CPA goal to $10.

```
$ cat line-item
{
    "line-item": {
    "name": "Weekday French Speakers Q3 2012",

}
```

```

### View all of an advertiser's line items

Unlike the examples above, this line item has a `goal_pixels` array of objects attached. Notice that even though this advertiser has only one line item, it's returned via the `line-items` JSON array.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?advertiser_id=51'
{
    "response": {
        "count": 3,
        "line-items": [
            { ..."id": 4274691,...},
            { ..."id": 4983291,...},
            { ..."id": 4983258,...}
        ]
    }
}
```

### Update a line item to use a revenue type of Cost Plus Margin (paying a flat CPM) and disable optimization

In this example, we are updating a line item to use a Revenue Type of Cost Plus Margin with a margin of 20% and with optimization disabled. The CPM is a flat CPM of 11.

```
{code}$ cat line_item_costplus_base.json
{
    "line-item": {
        "goal_type": "none",
        "goal_value": null,
        "inventory_type": "real_time",

### Update a line item to disable optimization

In this example, we are updating a line item to disable optimiztion.

```
{code}$ cat line_item_no_opt.json

### Create a Programmatic Guaranteed buying line item

Scenario: You have negotiated a Programmatic Guaranteed deal (PG deal) with a seller and would like to target this deal with a Programmatic Guaranteed buying line item (PG buying line item).

1. Create a PG deal profile and note the ID for this profile (see **Target a Programmatic Guaranteed deal** example in [Profile Service](profile-service.md)).

1. Create a PG buying line item JSON (you'll need an existing insertion order ID and profile ID).

    ``` 
    $ cat pg_buying_line_item
    {
      "line-item": {
        "insertion_orders": [
          {
            "id": 1234
          }
        ],
        "name": "My PG Buying Line Item",
        "state": "active",
        "ad_types": [
          "banner"
        ],
        "profile_id": 123456,
        "currency": "USD",
        "supply_strategies": {
          "rtb": false,
          "managed": false,
          "deals": false,
          "programmatic_guaranteed": true
        },
        "revenue_value": 0.0,
        "revenue_type": "cost_plus_margin",
        "creatives": [],
        "require_cookie_for_tracking": false,
        "line_item_type": "standard_v2",
        "manage_creative": true
      }
    }
    ```

1. Make a `POST` request to the **<https://api.appnexus.com/line-item>** endpoint using this PG buying line item JSON and the appropriate
`advertiser_id`.

    ```
    $ curl -b cookies -X POST -d @pg_buying_line_item 'https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?advertiser_id=123'
    {
