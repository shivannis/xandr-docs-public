# Digital Platform API - Key Value Analytics report

The Key Value Analytics report shows you the information associated with your network's defined targeting keys and values.

Impressions with key/value targeting will serve and be reported only for those impressions that were logged by a placement tag containing the **kw\_** prefix on the key name. For example, a placement tag containing *keyname=value1* will not serve and therefore not be logged, whereas a placement tag containing *kw_keyname=value1* will serve and be logged. This applies to `GET`-based query-string ad calls with the following tag types: `/tt`, `/ttj`, `/fpt`, `/jpt`, `/pt`, `/ptv`, `/ssptv`, `/mtj`, `/map`, `/mob`, `/prebid/amp`, `/vmap`, `/ssvmap`.

> [!NOTE]
> **AppNexus Seller Tags**
>
> When using [Seller Tag](../seller-tag/seller-tag.md), omit the **kw\_** prefix. AST has the keyword object in the body of the (ut/v3) request, so the prefix is not needed. The same holds true for other `POST`-based request body ad calls from Prebid (ut/v3/prebid, openrtb2/prebid, prebid/lfv) and OpenRTB (openrtb2).

Not all impressions from key/value targets will be included in reports. To be included, the targets must meet the following criteria:

- Key must be pre-defined. For more information, see the [Pre-Defining Targeting Keys and Values](../monetize/pre-defining-targeting-keys-and-values.md) page in the UI.
- Value must be pre-defined OR Value must be targeted by at least one line item or campaign.
- Value is not a numeric range (greater than or less than).
- Value does not include a wildcard.

## Time frame

The `report_interval` field in the JSON request can be set to one of the following:

- today
- yesterday
- last_24_hours
- last_48_hours
- last_7_days
- last_month
- month_to_date
- quarter_to_date

> [!NOTE]
> To run a report for a custom time frame, set the `start_date` and `end_date` fields in your report request. For more details about these fields, see [Report Service](report-service.md).

### Dates occurring greater than 45 days ago

If you create a Key Value Analytics report with the Range field set to Custom (where the end date is greater than 45 days from today), your report (regardless of metrics included) will be added to a special queue for "resource-intensive" reports. As a result, the report may take longer than usual to complete. In addition, this resource-intensive report may, due to the amount of data being requested, fail before being completed. If your report fails to complete, you will receive a notification. If your report request fails, you can:

- Rerun the report at a later time.
- Use a report type other than Key Value Analytics.
- Alter the way you structure your reports (if possible) so they do not include dates greater than 45 days ago.

If you are frequently requesting Key Value Analytics reports which include dates longer than 45 day ago, you may need to consider running
these reports via the API, caching the data and using [Bulk Reporting Feeds](bulk-reporting-feeds.md) or a [Log Level Data Feeds - Archive](../log-level-data/log-level-data-feeds.md). For more details on how to alter your reports to avoid these issues, see the [Dimensions, Metrics, Filtering, and Grouping](../invest/dimensions-metrics-filtering-and-grouping.md) page in the UI.

## Examples

### Create the JSON report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` of `"key_value_analytics"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and
specify the `"format"` in which the data should be returned (`"csv"`, `"excel"`, or `"html"`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](report-service.md).

```
$ cat key_value_analytics

{"report":
    {
        "report_type":"key_value_analytics",
        "columns":[
            "hour",
            "seller_member_id",
            "key_name",
            "key_name_label",
            "key_value",
            "key_value_label",
            "imps",
            "clicks",
            "revenue",
            "ctr"
        ],
        "report_interval":"last_48_hours",
        "format":"csv"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the [Report service](report-service.md)

`POST` the JSON request to get back a report ID.

```
$ curl -b cookies -X post -d @key_value_analytics "https://api.appnexus.com/report?advertiser_id=123"

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"09b6979a6a4c3805bdac8921378d3622"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the Report service

Make a `GET` call with the report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is
`"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=09b6979a6a4c3805bdac8921378d3622'

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report":{
         "name":null,
         "created_on":"2016-12-11 19:15:48",
         "json_request": "{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"key_value_analytics\",
             \"columns\":[\"hour\",\"seller_member_id\",
             \"key_name\",\"key_name_label\",\"key_value\",\"key_value_label\",
             \"imps\",\"clicks\",\"revenue\",\"ctr\"],
             \"report_interval\":\"last_48_hours\",\"format\":\"csv\",\"filters\":[{\"advertiser_id\":\"123\"}]}}",
             "url":"report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592"
      },
      "execution_status":"ready"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the Report Download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and report ID in the `url` field of the response to your previous `GET` call. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the file format that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!NOTE]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592' > /tmp/key_value_analytics.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
