# Managing custom creative and placement sizes

You can define custom dimensions and use those sizes when you [Working
with Creatives](working-with-creatives.md) or [placements](working-with-placements.md)
 to
the system. These size dimensions are applicable in numerous locations
throughout Microsoft Monetize. You can also indicate
whether a size is standard or non-standard, which allows you to
categorize the sizes as needed throughout the user interface.

On the **Custom Sizes** screen, you
can perform the following tasks:

- Define a new creative/placement size
- Edit existing creative/placement sizes
- Indicate whether a creative/placement size is designated as
  **standard** or
  **non-standard**
- Delete a creative/placement size

## Procedures

Navigate to the **Custom Sizes**
screen by selecting
**Network**  \> **Tools** \> **General** from the menu bar and
then select the **Custom Sizes** tab.

### Define a new size

1. Open the **Custom Size Details**
    dialog. Select the **New Custom Size**
    button at the top left of the screen. The
    **Custom Size Details** dialog
    appears.
1. Define the width and height of the creative/placement. Enter the
    values (in pixels) in the **Width**
    and **Height** fields.
1. Indicate if these dimensions are a standard size. If these
    dimensions should be considered standard, select the
    **Set as standard size** check box. If
    this option is checked, this size appears under the
    Standard Sizes header when working
    with creatives and placements. Conversely, if this option is not
    checked, this size appears under the
    **Non-Standard Sizes**. You should
    designate a size as Standard if it
    is a size that you expect to use often when defining creatives or
    placements, as these are at the top of the list of available sizes.
    The **Non-Standard Sizes** are those
    which are used less-frequently and are available at the bottom of
    the list.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > The sizes defined here are available on the following pages:
   > - **Network** >  **Reporting** ([Network Reporting](network-reporting.md))
   > - **Advertisers** > **Creative Manager** > **Single Creative** > **Creative Content** (Add a Third-Party Creative)
   > - **Advertisers** > **Creative Manager** > **Single Creative** > **Creative Content** (Add a Hosted Creative)
   > - **Advertisers** > **Reporting** ([Advertiser and Publisher User Reporting](advertiser-and-publisher-user-reporting.md))
   > - **Publishers** > **Create New Placement** > **Placement Details** tab
   > ([Create a Placement](create-a-placement.md))
   > - **Publishers** >  **Reporting** ([Advertiser and Publisher User Reporting](advertiser-and-publisher-user-reporting.md))

### Edit an existing size

1. Choose the size to be edited. Click any dimension in the list. The
    **Custom Size Details** dialog appears
    with the **Width** and
    **Height** fields already filled out.
1. Change the **width** and **height**. Update one or both of the values (in
    pixels) in the Width and
    Height fields.
1. Indicate whether these dimensions are a standard size. Change the
    **Set as standard size** check box as
    desired. If this option is checked, this size appears under the
    **Standard Sizes** header when working
    with creatives and placements. Conversely, if this option is not
    checked, this size appears under the
    **Non-Standard Sizes**. You should
    designate a size as **Standard** if it
    is a size that you expect to use often when defining creatives or
    placements, as these are at the top of the list of available sizes.
    The **Non-Standard Sizes** are those
    which are used less-frequently, and they are available at the bottom
    of the list.

    **Size** (at the top of the list of
    sizes) to select all sizes.
