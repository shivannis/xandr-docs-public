## To run your report

Follow these steps to run your report.

1. Select **Reporting** from the
    appropriate top menu (depending on how your account has been
    configured).
    1. Or, from the Publishers top menu, click on **Prebid Server Premium** \> **Analytics** \> **Prebid Server Analytics**.
1. Select the relevant report from the list. The
    **Report** screen shows the available
    filters, dimensions, and delivery options for the report. The
    selections you make here will determine what report data is
    delivered to you, and how.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For an explanation of how grouping and filtering work, see [Dimensions, Metrics, Filtering, and Grouping](dimensions-metrics-filtering-and-grouping.md).

1. Select the relevant filters to limit the data displayed to just the
    information you want. For example, rather than running a report that
    shows impressions for all inventory sources, you may want to list
    results for just a select few. When you select a filter (by clicking
    **Edit**), a selection panel appears.
    Select items in the **Available** list (left), then click
    **Add** to include them in the
    **Chosen** list (right).
1. Group by Dimension. Grouping allows you to display rows of data in
    the order you prefer.

    > [!WARNING]
    > The more dimensions you group by, the larger the data set that is returned. Larger data sets can take substantially longer to process. Be sure to group using only the dimensions you need.

1. Choose a delivery option. Once you've selected your filters and
    grouped by your chosen dimensions, you need to choose a delivery
    method. Available delivery methods include:
    - **Run now, show results in screen**: For smaller amounts of data,
      you may want to view the report as soon as possible in your
      browser. You can download the report in XLSX, CSV, Excel/TSV and
      JSON format. However, there is a limit of 100,000 rows per report
      when downloading as XLSX and Excel file.
    - **Run in background, notify me when results are ready to view**: A
      popup notification will let you know when the report is ready to
      view or download.

      > [!TIP]
      > The maximum size of the report that can be downloaded from the UI is 100 MB. Also, there is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when downloading as XLSX and Excel file. If the size of the report is more than that, you can try to download it using the [API](../digital-platform-api/report-service.md) for that reporting service (The limit here is 10 million rows).

    - **Export, send results via email**: Run the report in the background and email the results to
      one or more email addresses.
    - **Save as report template**: Save your selected report settings so
      that you can run this report again in the future. You can name
      this template using the text entry field under
      **Name this report** (its checkbox
      is auto-selected when you choose this option). A saved report can
      be rerun from the **Your Reports**
      screen.
    - **Add to scheduled reports**: Run this report automatically at
      specified times and have it sent to one or more email addresses.
