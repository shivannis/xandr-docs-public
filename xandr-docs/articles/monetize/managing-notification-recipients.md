# Microsoft Monetize - Managing notification recipients

From the Network menu, you can control who
receives email notifications from Microsoft Advertising for
various alerts, including creative audit, object limit, inventory
deactivation, and toolbar flag alerts using your notification settings.

> [!TIP]
> If you need multiple team members to receive notifications, you might want to create an email list that you can manage internally and use a single address for notification emails. For example, `notification@yourcompany.com` could include multiple internal team members, and you could adjust notification recipients by adding them to, or removing them from, the main `notification@yourcompany.com` list. You wouldn't have to make any additional changes within your notification settings.

## Safety budget

For setting recipients for daily safety budget notifications, see [Capping Daily Spend on Third-Party Inventory (Safety
Budget)](capping-daily-spend-on-third-party-inventory-safety-budget.md).

## Audit notification

Enter the recipients who should receive a notification when
Microsoft Advertising audits a creative belonging to this
member. The notification includes the creative's audit status and any
reasons why the creative has not passed audit.

## Sherlock and object limit notification

Enter the recipients who should receive a notification when Sherlock
scans a creative belonging to this member. The notification includes the
creative's audit status and any reasons why the creative has not passed
audit. See [Sherlock: Creative Quality Control](sherlock-creative-quality-control.md) for more information.

These recipients will also receive object limit notifications, sent when
you reach 85, 95, and 100 percent of your limit for an object. See [Viewing Your Object Limits](viewing-your-object-limits.md) for more information.

## Inventory deactivation & toolbar flag notification

Enter the recipients who should receive a notification when
Microsoft Advertising identifies invalid traffic or toolbar
inventory. The notification will include information about the kind of
invalid traffic or what non ad-supported or Owned & Operated domains
your tag served on.
