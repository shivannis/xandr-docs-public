# Microsoft Monetize - comScore agent

**comScore Agent** app allows users to create custom segments using a combination of keywords, content categorization and brand protection data to surface quality, brand safe inventory in Microsoft Advertising.

## Description

comScore's Agents 2.0 is a powerful set of functionality to help you navigate the inventory in Microsoft Advertising. Name your Agent, select the categories and brand protection parameters that suit your specific campaign. If IAB categories are not enough, build your own Custom Segments by using search or social interest keywords and/or URLs that have converted for you in the past and click Submit.

Every time you make a selection, we provide instant feedback on available inventory so you can plan your campaign better. Set up multiple Agents for different campaigns and modify them in real-time, along with other campaign criteria, to optimize your campaign's performance.
