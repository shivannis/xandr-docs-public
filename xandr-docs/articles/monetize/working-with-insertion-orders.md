# Microsoft Monetize - Working with insertion orders

Insertion orders allow you to easily manage collections of line items that may share a common budget, time span, and business terms. Insertion orders are a standard part of the [Object Hierarchy](object-hierarchy.md). An insertion order can contain one or more line items. For example, you may want to set a common budget and billing periods for several line items, but have each line item target a different region or buy different types of media.

Note that there are two types of insertion orders (for more information, see [Create an Insertion Order](create-an-insertion-order.md)):

- **Legacy** - Legacy insertion order required for legacy guaranteed and non-guaranteed line items.
- **Seamless** - Seamless insertion order compatible with augmented line items (ALI), guaranteed delivery augmented line items (GDALI), and programmatic guaranteed line items (PGLI).

Some useful procedures when creating and working with insertion orders here:

- **[Create an Insertion Order](create-an-insertion-order.md)** - Set up an insertion order (formerly "seamless insertion order") in Microsoft Monetize.
- **[Create a Legacy Insertion Order](create-a-legacy-insertion-order.md)** - Set up an old-style insertion order in Microsoft Monetize. Legacy insertion orders do not use billing periods, can't be used with the recommended augmented line item, and are no longer the best practice.
- **[Explore Insertion Orders](explore-insertion-orders.md)** - View essential metrics about insertion orders under a specific advertiser, get quick access to each insertion order's details and child line items, and use bulk editing and reporting options.
- **[View Insertion Order Details](view-insertion-order-details.md)** - View the settings and essential metrics for a specific insertion order, analyze visualizations of the insertion order's performance, get quick access to the insertion order's child objects, and more.
- **[View Legacy Insertion Order Details](view-legacy-insertion-order-details.md)** - View the settings and essential
  metrics for a specific legacy insertion order, analyze visualizations of the insertion order's performance, get quick access to the insertion order's child objects, and more.
- **[Update Insertion Orders](update-insertion-orders.md)** - Update the details of an insertion order in Microsoft Monetize.
- **[Reporting on Insertion Orders](explore-insertion-orders.md)** - Initiate an advertiser analytics report for one or more insertion orders.
- **[Improve Performance with Visual Success](improve-performance-with-visual-success.md)** - View Visual Success data for insertion orders and use it to troubleshoot.
