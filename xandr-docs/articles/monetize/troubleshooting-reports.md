# Microsoft Monetize - Troubleshooting reports

**Troubleshooting Reports** provides you easy access to set up and run reports that can help you troubleshoot line items.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Microsoft Monetize Monitoring feature is in **Open Beta** and currently only supports deal line items, augmented line items (ALI), and guaranteed delivery augmented line items (GDALI). It is subject to change without notice and is only available to select clients.

These reports are simplified versions of the most common reports available. For more information, see [Network Reporting](network-reporting.md). You can use these reports to further investigate any issues surfaced in the **Impression Funnel** section. For more information, see [Impression Funnel](impression-funnel.md).
