# Microsoft Monetize - Buying GumGum inventory

You can enhance user engagement via [GumGum "in-image" or "in-screen" units](https://gumgum.com/guides/the-straightforward-guide-to-in-image-advertising),
which are available programmatically through
Microsoft Advertising. GumGum ad campaigns involve a few
adjustments to the process of uploading standard display campaigns. This
page will guide you through this process and explain how to display your
creative via GumGum's inventory.

## Upload a third-party creative

Navigate to the **Creative Manager**
screen. Click on the **Create New** button
and select your creative type from the menu. In the **New Creative**
dialog box select the following values:

- **Type : Third Party Creative**
- **Creative Format**: **Third-Party Tag**
- **Tag Type: This tag is HTML**
- **Media Type: Banner: Standard Banner**
- **Template: Microsoft Advertising Standard**
- **Size:** See the table below for recommended sizes depending on your
  GumGum inventory selection. For example, "10x10" for the Studio
  728x90.
- **Name:** Self classify the creative with the accurate brand.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not submit for audit since the creative will only be able to render on GumGum's inventory and the Microsoft Advertising team cannot audit it.

| GumGum Product | Microsoft Advertising Size |
|---|---|
| In-Image | 13x13 |
| In-Image 728x90 | 10x10 |
| In-Image Animated | 12x12 |
| In-Image Canvas | 16x16 |
| In-Image Embedded Video | 18x18 |
| In-Screen | 17x17 |
| In-Screen Embedded Video | 19x19 |

> [!NOTE]
> Custom Creative Configuration Required. All of GumGum products require a custom creative configuration that they will have to provide. The only exception is the in-image studio 728x90 creative, which you can leverage the existing 3rd party tags for a 728x90 used for display. GumGum can read that HTML tag and adjust it to fit their inventory.

## Check the rendering of GumGum creatives

> [!NOTE]
> This is not needed for the In-Image Studio 728x90 product because that can be rendered in console by using the actual size.

### Step 1. View the creative

Use the [https://gumgum.com/creative-preview](https://gumgum.com/creative-preview)to view
creative.

### Step 2. Enter The HTML tag code

Enter the creative ad HTML code into the field in the bottom-half panel
and select the correct product type.

### Step 3. Preview

Click **preview**.
