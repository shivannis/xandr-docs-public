# Set targeting access privileges

You can set targeting access privileges for a specific buyer within the **Partner Controls** tab. The more information you expose to buyers, the more easily they can target your inventory. If you do not set targeting access for the buyer, your default targeting access settings will apply.

You can also [manage a buyer's targeting access settings](edit-buyer-eligibility-allowed-payment-types-and-targeting-access.md) in the **Partner Center** screen. However, you can only view the buyer's current settings on the **Partner Privileges** tab.

## Getting there

Select **Partners** > **Partner Center** from the top navigation menu.

## Step 1. Get started

Once in the **Partner Center**, click on the **Partner Controls** tab.

## Step 2. Switch to edit mode

Click **Edit** to make the targeting access settings editable.

## Step 3. Update settings

Select the desired radio button for each targeting access option, **Hide** (hide information from the buyer) or **Expose** (show information to the buyer).

For more information on the different targeting access options, see the **Setting default targeting access** section within [Setting Buyer Defaults](partner-center-screen-seller-view.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Age and gender targeting information can only be shared if you include the Microsoft Advertising age and gender macro when exporting your placement tag. For more information, see [Placement Tag Parameters](placement-tag-parameters.md).
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will have the option to expose domains or full URLs to external buyers.

For **Categories (Custom)**, there is the additional option to expose specific categories. To select specific custom categories, click the **Edit** button near the **Expose Custom** option to open the **Categories** dialog. Click on a category in the **Available Items** area to add it to the **Selected Items** area. To remove a category from the **Selected Items** area, click on the **X** next to the category name. When you have finished selecting custom categories, click **Add** to save your changes.

## Step 4. Save your changes

When all changes have been made, click the **Apply** button.
