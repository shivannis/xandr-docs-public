# Sell-Side reporting on deals

Once you've started selling deals, you can run reports to analyze how
your deals are performing.

- **Network Analytics** - The [Network Analytics Report](network-analytics-report.md) lets you view deal performance, revenue, and profit data across multiple publishers' sites.
- **Publisher Analytics** - The [Publisher Analytics](publisher-analytics.md) report lets you view deal performance, revenue, and profit data for a
  specific publisher's sites.
- **Partner Center Reporting Link** - The [Show in Reporting](partnership-details-screen-buyer-view.md) button provides a link between managing your deals in the Partner Center and checking on deal performance in the [Network Analytics Report](network-analytics-report.md).

For each of these reports, you can group by **Deal** to report on
multiple deals at once, or you can filter by **Deal** to report on
specific deals.
