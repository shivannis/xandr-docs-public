## Currency 2.0

> [!NOTE]
> By enabling **Currency 2.0**, you can select a currency for each individual report if you prefer not to use **USD** as the default currency. The report will show all the monetary fields in your report using the selected currency. For example, if you select **Advertiser**, click the **Currency 2.0** toggle to enable it, and select **Japanese Yen (JPY)** from the **Currency** menu, the report will show all monetary data in JPY, including data associated with child objects such as line items.

## Dimensions

| Column | Filter? | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Insertion Order | Yes | The name and ID of the insertion order under which the impression was purchased. For more information about insertion orders, see [Working with Insertion Orders](working-with-insertion-orders.md). |
| Line Item | Yes | The name and ID of the line item under which the impression was purchased. For more information about line items, see [Working with Line Items](working-with-line-items.md). |
| Campaign | Yes | The name and ID of the campaign that purchased this impression. (Does not apply to all advertisers.) |
| Seller | Yes | The seller/publisher who sold the impressions in this data set. |
| Split | Yes | The name and ID of the split that purchased the impressions in this data set. Splits are only applicable to augmented line items. For any rows with a campaign name, the **Split** column (if included) will be null. |
| Site Domain | No | The domain where the impression occurred. For mobile applications, this can be the URL of the app's location in the app store. There are two additional values that may appear in place of a domain, specifically: "`deals.unknown`" or "`managed.unknown`". These mean that we didn't receive a valid domain as the referrer. For example, the domain may be blank or otherwise malformed. |
| Mobile Application | No | For mobile app impressions, the Apple App Store or Google Play name and ID of the mobile application where the impression occurred, for example, "`Angry Birds (343200656)` or "`Angry Birds (com.rovio.angrybirds)`". |
| Top-level category | No | The name and ID of the top-level content category associated with the domain; for example, "`Shopping (19821)`". |
| Second-level category | No | The name and ID second-level content category associated with the domain; for example, "`Shoes (20129)`". |
| Remarketing Segment | No | Indicator of whether this is a remarketing campaign. |
| Age | Yes | The age of the user associated with the impression. For impressions older than 100 days, the age will be "unknown". |
| Gender | Yes | The gender of the user. For impressions older than 100 days, the gender will be "unknown". |
| Fold Position | Yes | The fold position of the impression (i.e., where on the page the placement is located).<br>Possible values for impressions:<br> - unknown<br> - above<br> - below |
| Operating System Family | Yes | The operating system family (e.g., Apple Mac, Chrome OS) associated with the impressions. |
| Operating System | Yes | The name and ID of the operating system of the device where the impression occurred. |
| Supply Type | Yes | The seller-classified channel to denominate supply in terms of web, mobile-optimized web, and mobile app impressions. Possible values are "`web`", "`mobile_app`", and "`mobile_web`". |
| Conversion Pixel | Yes | The unique identification number of the conversion pixel.<br>**Note**: This dimension will return a maximum of 10 conversion pixels. Also, you can filter by no more than 10 conversion pixels. Although Pixel ID groupable, we do not recommend that you group by this dimension since doing so will cause conversion events to then be shown in separate rows from impression and click events. We generally assume you want to view all of these events in a single row so as to be able to retrieve accurate and aggregated values for conversion rate and cost-per-conversion calculations. As a result, we instead recommend that you filter by Pixel ID so you can retrieve conversion counts and related metrics for your most relevant pixel IDs. |
| Deal | Yes | The deal through which this impression was purchased. |
| Buying Currency | No | The transaction currency that the buyer used to purchase this impression. Including this dimension will cause the monetary metrics to be displayed in the buying currency. This dimension is available only when Currency 2.0 is disabled. |

> [!NOTE]
> You can also filter on a particular number of impressions using the **Minimum Impressions** filter.

## To run your report

Follow these steps to run your report.

1. Select **Reporting** from the appropriate top menu (depending on how your account has been configured).
   1. Or, from the Publishers top menu, click on **Prebid Server Premium** \> **Analytics** \>  **Prebid Server Analytics**.
1. Select the relevant report from the list. The **Report** screen shows the available filters, dimensions, and delivery options for the report. The selections you make here will determine what report data is delivered to you, and how.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For an explanation of how grouping and filtering work, see [Dimensions, Metrics, Filtering, and Grouping](dimensions-metrics-filtering-and-grouping.md).

1. Select the relevant filters to limit the data displayed to just the information you want. For example, rather than running a report that shows impressions for all inventory sources, you may want to list results for just a select few. When you select a filter (by clicking **Edit**), a selection panel appears. Select items in the **Available** list (left), then click **Add** to include them in the **Chosen** list (right).
1. Group by Dimension. Grouping allows you to display rows of data in the order you prefer.

   > [!WARNING]
   >  The more dimensions you group by, the larger the data set that is returned. Larger data sets can take substantially longer to process. Be sure to group using only the dimensions you need.

1. Choose a delivery option. Once you've selected your filters and grouped by your chosen dimensions, you need to choose a delivery method. Available delivery methods include:
    - **Run now, show results in screen**: For smaller amounts of data, you may want to view the report as soon as possible in your browser. You can download the report in XLSX, CSV, Excel/TSV and JSON format. However, there is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when downloading as XLSX and Excel file.
    - **Run in background, notify me when results are ready to view**: A popup notification will let you know when the report is ready to view or download.

      > [!TIP]
      > The maximum size of the report that can be downloaded from the UI is 100 MB. Also, there is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when downloading as XLSX and Excel file. If the size of the report is more than that, you can try to download it using the [API](../digital-platform-api/report-service.md) for that reporting service (The limit here is 10 million rows).

    - **Export, send results via email**: Run the report in the background and email the results to one or more email addresses.
    - **Save as report template**: Save your selected report settings so that you can run this report again in the future. You can name this template using the text entry field under **Name this report** (its checkbox is auto-selected when you choose this option). A saved report can be rerun from the **Your Reports** screen.
    - **Add to scheduled reports**: Run this report automatically at specified times and have it sent to one or more email addresses.
    - **Name this report**: Give this report with its current settings a name for future reference.
1. Click **Run report** to send your report request.
