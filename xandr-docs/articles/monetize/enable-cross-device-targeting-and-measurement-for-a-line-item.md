# Microsoft Monetize - Enable cross-device targeting and measurement for a line item

You can optionally enable the cross-device targeting and measurement feature on a line item to apply frequency caps, conversion attribution, and audience targeting settings for individual users across multiple devices.

The **Cross-Device** pull-down menu appears in the **Audience & Location Targeting** section. It is disabled by default.

> [!NOTE]
> Cross-device targeting carries a cost-per-mille (CPM) or cost-per-thousand-impressions charge, which is noted next to the name of the identity provider you select.
> Microsoft Advertising clears this charge with the data provider, and it is included in your total costs in reporting.
> [!WARNING]
> Cross-device functionality is available to sellers when running line items that purchase inventory from the ad exchange using RTB. It's not available when sellers are
> running managed campaigns on their own inventory.

For more information about how identity graphs and cross-device targeting works, see [Cross-Device Targeting and Measurement](cross-device-targeting-and-measurement.md).

To enable cross-device tracking and measurement, select the identity graph you want to use to connect users across devices.
