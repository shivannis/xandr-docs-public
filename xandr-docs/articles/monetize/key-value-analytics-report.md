# Microsoft Monetize - Key value analytics report

The Key Value Analytics report shows you the information associated with your network's defined targeting keys and values.

Impressions with key/value targeting will serve and be reported only for those impressions that were logged by a placement tag containing the `kw_` prefix on the key name. For example, a placement tag containing `keyname=value1` will not serve and therefore not be logged, whereas a placement tag containing `kw_keyname=value1` will serve and be logged. This applies to GET-based query-string ad calls with the following tag types: `/tt`, `/ttj`, `/fpt,` `/jpt`, `/pt`, `/ptv`, `/ssptv`, `/mtj`, `/map`, `/mob`, `/prebid/amp`, `/vmap`, `/ssvmap`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Microsoft Advertising Seller Tags:** When using [Microsoft Advertising's seller tag](../seller-tag/seller-tag.md) (AST), omit the `kw_` prefix. AST has the keyword object in the body of the (`ut/v3`) request, so the prefix is not needed. The same holds true for other POST-based request body ad calls from Prebid (`ut/v3/prebid`, `openrtb2/prebid`, `prebid/lfv`) and OpenRTB (`openrtb2`).

Not all impressions from key/value targets will be included in reports. To be included, the targets must meet the following criteria:

- Key must be pre-defined.
- Value must be pre-defined OR targeted by at least one line item or campaign.
- Value is not a numeric range (greater than or less than).
- Value does not include a wildcard.

## Time frame

All dates and times are given in UTC.

### Time ranges

Time ranges define the time period of the data extracted for the report. The following is a complete list of time ranges available for reports.

However, all time ranges are not available for every report.

### Intervals

Intervals determine how your data is grouped together into rows in the report response. The following is a complete list of intervals available for reports. However, all intervals are not available for every report.

- Hourly: Data is grouped into rows by the hour.
- Daily: Data is grouped into rows by the day.
- Monthly: Data is grouped into rows by the month.
- Cumulative: Data is grouped together in one figure, covering the entire selected time range.

For more information about how quickly reporting data is processed, see [Availability of Reporting Data](availability-of-reporting-data.md).

### Time ranges including dates occurring more than 45 days ago

If you create a Key Value Analytics report with the Range field set to **Custom** (where the end date is more than 45 days from today), your report (regardless of metrics included) will be added to a special queue for "resource-intensive" reports. As a result, the report may take longer than usual to complete. In addition, this resource-intensive report may, due to the amount of data being requested, fail before being completed. If your report fails to complete, you will receive a notification. If your report request fails, you can:

- rerun the report at a later time.
- use a report type other than Key Value Analytics.
- alter the way you structure your reports (if possible) so they do not include dates greater than 45 days ago.

If you are frequently requesting Key Value Analytics reports which include dates longer than 45 days ago, you may need to consider running these reports via the API, caching the data and using [Bulk Reporting Feeds](../digital-platform-api/bulk-reporting-feeds.md) or [Log-Level Data Feeds](../log-level-data/log-level-data-feeds.md) (LLD). See [Dimensions, Metrics, Filtering, and Grouping](dimensions-metrics-filtering-and-grouping.md) for more details on how to alter your reports to avoid these issues.

### Data retention period

Data in this report is retained for 14 months. After 100 days, you are no longer able to report on hourly data. However, daily, monthly and cumulative intervals are still available.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Lifetime Analytics Data is retained for 14 months.**
>
> In some cases Analytics reports can show delivery that does not match statistics shown elsewhere in Microsoft Monetize for a given advertiser or publisher. This is due to the fact that Analytics reporting data is purged after 14 months, whereas the data from QuickStats and Billing reports is kept indefinitely.

## Currency 2.0

> [!NOTE]
> By enabling **Currency 2.0**, you can select a currency for each individual report if you prefer not to use **USD** as the default currency. The report will show all the monetary fields in your report using the selected currency. For example, if you select **Advertiser**, click the **Currency 2.0** toggle to enable it, and select **Japanese Yen (JPY)** from the **Currency** menu, the report will show all monetary data in JPY, including data associated with child objects such as line items.

## To run your report

Follow these steps to run your report.

1. Select **Reporting** from the appropriate top menu (depending on how your account has been configured).

    Or, from the **Publishers** top menu, click on **Prebid Server Premium** > **Analytics** > **Prebid Server Analytics**

1. Select the relevant report from the list. The **Report** screen shows the available filters, dimensions, and delivery options for the report. The selections you make here will determine what report data is delivered to you, and how.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For an explanation of how grouping and filtering work, see [Dimensions, Metrics, Filtering, and Grouping](dimensions-metrics-filtering-and-grouping.md).

1. Select the relevant filters to limit the data displayed to just the information you want. For example, rather than running a report that shows impressions for all inventory sources, you may want to list results for just a select few. When you select a filter (by clicking **Edit**), a selection panel appears. Select items in the **Available** list (left), then click **Add** to include them in the **Chosen** list (right).

1. Group by Dimension. Grouping allows you to display rows of data in the order you prefer.

    > [!WARNING]
    > The more dimensions you group by, the larger the data set that is returned. Larger data sets can take substantially longer to process. Be sure to group using only the dimensions you need.

1. Choose a delivery option. Once you've selected your filters and grouped by your chosen dimensions, you need to choose a delivery method. Available delivery methods include:
    - **Run now, show results in screen**: For smaller amounts of data, you may want to view the report as soon as possible in your browser. You can download the report in XLSX, CSV, Excel/TSV, and JSON format. However, there is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when downloading as XLSX and Excel file.
    - **Run in background, notify me when results are ready to view**: A popup notification will let you know when the report is ready to view or download.

      > [!TIP]
      > The maximum size of the report that can be downloaded from the UI is 100 MB. Also, there is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when downloading as XLSX and Excel file. If the size of the report is more than that, you can try to download it using the [API](../digital-platform-api/report-service.md) for that reporting service (The limit here is 10 million rows).

    - **Export, send results via email**: Run the report in the background and email the results to one or more email addresses.
    - **Save as report template**: Save your selected report settings so that you can run this report again in the future. You can name this template using the text entry field under **Name this report** (its checkbox is auto-selected when you choose this option). A saved report can be rerun from the **Your Reports** screen.
    - **Add to scheduled reports**: Run this report automatically at specified times and have it sent to one or more email addresses.
    - **Name this report**: Give this report with its current settings a name for future reference.

1. Click **Run report** to send your report request.
