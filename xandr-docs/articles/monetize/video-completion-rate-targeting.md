# Microsoft Monetize - Video completion rate targeting

You can opt to buy only video impressions that are predicted to result
in the video being viewed to completion by selecting the
**Video Completion Rate Threshold**
checkbox in the **Viewability & Environment
Targeting** section and entering a percentage value.
For a standard line item, this setting is located in
the **Targeting** settings.

Microsoft Advertising collects historical information about
video completion in order to predict the probability that a particular
video creative will be played to completion.
