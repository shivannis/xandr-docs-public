# Update a placement group

You can delete placement groups, and also move placements to a different
placement group. If you want to delete a placement group but keep the
placements, you need to first move the placements to another group.

## Get started

**Publisher-only clients:** Select
**Placements** from the
**Inventory** menu in the main
navigation menu, then select the publisher you want to work with from
the **Select a Publisher** dialog. This opens the **Placement Manager**,
which shows both the **Placement Group
List** and the **Placement List**
under each placement group for the publisher.

**All other clients:** Go to
**Publishers** \> **Placement Manager**.
This takes you to the **Placement
Manager**, which shows both the
**Placement Group List** and the
**Placement List** under each
placement group for the publisher.

## Move existing placements to a different placement group

Check the boxes for all the placements you want to move to another new
placement group, then click
**More Actions** \> **Move**. This will
open the **Select a destination placement group** dialog. Click
**Select** to complete the action.

## Delete the old placement group

> [!WARNING]
> If you plan to delete a placement group but do not want to delete the placements associated to it, you must first move its placements to another placement group. Otherwise the placements will be deleted along with it.

Check the checkbox for the placement group you want to delete and then
select **More Actions** \> **Delete**. A
confirmation dialog shows you the placement groups that you have
selected for deletion. Click **Confirm**
to finalize the deletion.
