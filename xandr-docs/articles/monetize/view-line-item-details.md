# Microsoft Monetize - View Line Item Details

The **Line Item Details** screen shows you the settings and essential metrics for a specific line item, informs you of conditions preventing the line item from serving, provides visualizations of the line item's performance and delivery, offers quick access to the line item's child campaigns, and more.

## Getting to the Line Item Details pane

On the **Line Items** screen, hover over the line item for which you want to view advanced details and click the **graph** button.

This takes you to the **Line Item Details** screen.

## Viewing visual success data

Visual Success is a tool designed to help campaign managers achieve better overall performance. It provides easy access to performance, delivery, and other metrics for your line item. You can use these metrics to see how the campaigns under your line item are performing as a group, and assess for possible trouble spots at the campaign and line item levels.

With Visual Success, you can:

- View flight progress, delivery, performance, and margin
- Scan for problems using easy-to-read data visualizations
- Keep track of how well line items are pacing to goals
- Hover over the visuals to see specific data for a single day

Visual Success features appear at the top of the **Line Item Details** screen. The metrics sections and graphs show important information about the line item's flight, delivery, performance and margin.

For more information, see [Improve Performance with Visual Success](improve-performance-with-visual-success.md).

## Viewing line item settings

The **Line Item Settings** section shows the basic details, frequency caps, reporting labels, commissions, associated insertion orders (when relevant), and dynamic landing page URL, as well as inventory, geography, and system targeting (if set).

The **Basic Settings** button shows the **Basic Setup**, **Frequency Cap**, **Geography Targeting**, **System Targeting**, **Inventory Targeting**, **Key Value Targeting**, and **Insertion Order Settings** (if applicable).

The **All Settings** button shows these settings as well as **Commissions**, **Comments**, **Dynamic Landing Page**, and parent **Insertion Orders** (if applicable).

## Basic setup

- **State**: The state of the line item (active or inactive).
- **Lifetime Budget**: The lifetime budget for the line item (in impressions or revenue).
- **Daily Budget**: The daily budget for the line item, in impressions or revenue.
- **Revenue Type**: The basis on which the advertiser has agreed to pay you. For example, CPM (per thousand impressions) or CPA (per conversion). For more information about each revenue type, see [Create a Standard Line Item](create-a-standard-line-item.md).
- **Revenue Value**: The amount that the advertiser will pay you for the specified revenue type.
- **Conversion Tracking**: The name and ID of each conversion pixel associated to this line item.
- **Performance Goal Type**: The type of goal that the advertiser wants you to achieve (CPC, CPA, CTR). A performance goal is used to achieve a goal that is different from how the advertiser has agreed to pay you. For example, the advertiser wants to pay a CPM but expects you to meet a $50 CPA goal. For more information about performance goals, see [Create a Standard Line Item](create-a-standard-line-item.md).
- **Performance Goal Tracking**: The amount for the performance goal.

## Frequency caps

- **Frequency Caps**: How frequently the creatives associated to campaigns under this line item can be shown. This can be:
  - Number of creatives shown to a given user over the lifetime of the line item
  - Number of creatives shown to a given user per day
  - Number of minutes/hours/days that must pass before a given user can be shown another creative
- **Cookies**: Whether or not the creatives associated to campaigns under this line item can be shown to users without cookies. Be aware that frequency caps do not apply to such users.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Frequency caps and whether to show to cookieless users can also be set at the advertiser, insertion order, campaign, and creative levels, or any combination of the five levels. The most restrictive setting always takes precedence. For more information, see [Frequency Targeting](frequency-and-recency-caps.md).

## Reporting labels

This section shows if a **Trafficker**, **Salesperson**, or **Campaign Type** has been associated with the line item. If so, you can run reports by these labels. For example, you might associate a salesperson with each of your line items and then run a report grouped by salesperson to compare line item performance across salespersons.

## Commissions

This section shows any commissions that have been associated with the line item. Commissions let you attribute revenue to third-parties. They are deducted from the booked revenue (the amount the advertiser pays you) of the line item and can be defined either as a percentage of booked revenue or a flat CPM. For more information about commissions, see [Broker Fees](broker-fees.md).

## Associated insertion orders

This section shows the names and IDs of all insertion orders to which the line item is associated.

## Dynamic landing page

If you have associated multiple creatives to a single landing page, this section shows the landing page URL to use for the creatives. Note that you can set a dynamic landing page at the campaign level as well. For more information, see [Dynamic Landing Pages](dynamic-landing-pages.md).

## Comments

This section shows any comments that have been recorded with the line item. Comments are for reference only and do not affect line item delivery.

## Viewing sibling line items

You can view the other line items under the same advertiser or insertion order in the sibling line item list at the side of the screen. You can click on any line item in the list to go to the **Line Item Details** screen for that line item. The slider at the side of the screen allows you to expand and adjust the view.

## Viewing associated campaigns and campaign details summaries

## Viewing associated campaigns

You can view the campaigns that belong to the line item on the **Line Item Details** screen. To do so, click to expand the **Campaigns** section to view the campaign list.
