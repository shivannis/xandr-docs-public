# Microsoft Monetize - Migrating from broker fees to partner fees

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Partner Fees are an enhancement and replacement for [Broker Fees](broker-fees.md) for augmented line items (ALIs) and programmatic guaranteed line items (PGLIs).

If you're migrating from [Broker Fees](broker-fees.md), you'll find
partner fees work differently in a few ways:

- Partner fees apply only to augmented line items (ALIs) and guaranteed
  delivery line items (GDLIs).
- Partner fees can be eligible for multiple advertisers and can be
  applied to multiple line items.
- A particular partner fee can be made required or optional for all an
  advertiser's augmented line items.
- Partner fees cannot be applied to insertion orders.

All serving fees on existing augmented line items have already been
converted to partner fees. You can view them in the
**Fees** section of the line item. If you
have Network-level access, hover over your
member name in the upper-right corner of the menu bar and click
**Fees** to access the
**Fees** screen.

## Reporting changes

With partner fees, several new metrics have been added to reports and
there has been a standardization of how metrics are named and calculated
across different reports. This resulted in the deprecation of some
metrics and changes in the definitions of others.

Fields are now defined as follows for every report in which they appear:

- **Partner fees**: The total amount of third party costs, budgeted
  using Partner Fees, that have accrued on an augmented line item over
  the reported period of time.

- **Total cost**: All costs that are paid out to third parties. For
  buyers, total cost is all costs included in the budget, including
  media cost, data cost, partner fees, serving fees, and commissions.
  For sellers, total cost is any publisher revenue paid
  out to publishers, whether as revshare or CPM. Total costs are
  calculated as follows:
  - **Total cost**: media costs + data cost + partner fees +
    commissions + serving fees OR publisher revenue
  - **Total cost eCPM**: (total cost/imps) \* 1,000
  - **Total cost eCPC**: total cost/clicks
  - **Total cost eCPA**: total cost/conversions

- **Profit**: In the past, we have sometimes used "profit" to represent
  buyer profit and sometimes used it to represent
  Network profit. Going forward, it will always
  indicate buyer profit (booked revenue - total cost).

- **Network profit**: The sum of booked revenue
  and reseller revenue, minus total cost.

  Profit metrics based on including broker fees or data cost, but not
  including media cost, will be retired, in favor of the new definition
  of profit based on total cost. You will still be able to determine
  separate media and data costs.

## Transition period

The transition to partner fees was completed **November 12, 2019**. For
reports and metrics related to ALIs prior to that date, some things to
keep in mind:

- Reports which already had profit fields will continue to use the
  definitions they had used in the past.
- Logic was added to prevent double-counting third party costs (partner
  fees vs commissions & serving fees) in total cost metrics for ALIs.
- Commissions are no longer populated for augmented line items. These
  fees appear in the **partner fees**
  field.

## Affected reports

The changes for each report are summarized in the tables below.

## Standard line items

If you still use standard line items, you must use
<a href="broker-fees.md" class="xref">Broker Fees</a> to administer
third-party fees for those. You can still apply broker fees on the
insertion order, line item, or campaign; however, if the insertion order
has both standard and augmented line items, the broker fees **will only
apply to the standard line items**. You must create partner fees for
augmented line items even if the parent insertion order has a broker fee
applied.

## Log-Level data

Partner fees are reported in the field `partner_fees` in the [Standard Feed](../log-level-data/standard-feed.md).
