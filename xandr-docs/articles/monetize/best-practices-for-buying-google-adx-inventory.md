# Microsoft Monetize - Best practices for buying Google Ad Manager inventory

This page provides recommendations for maximum ad campaign success when
targeting Google Ad Manager inventory.

## General

The following are general guidelines to target inventory:

- Create a separate line item or campaign
  targeting Google Ad Manager(181). This is recommended, but not
  required.
- Make sure to turn off all inventory quality settings by setting your
  **Inventory Quality** Targeting to **Serve on any inventory**.
- The VAST tag must include the following formats since Google Ad
  Manager can request any of them on a bid request:
  - H.264 (MP4)
  - FlashVideo (FLV)
  - WebM
- The skip offset must be 5 seconds, otherwise the bid will be filtered
  out in Google Ad Manager's auction.

## Creative guidelines

The following are guidelines specific to creative standards required for
Google Ad Manager:

- Must be SSL compliant. Serving on secure inventory is selected by
  default. Do NOT make any changes to the setting when you are creating
  a new creative.

- Click the **Run Check** button to have
  our VAST check scan your XML document. For more details, see [VAST Check](vast-check.md).

  For more information about adding in-stream video creatives, see [Add
  a Creative](add-a-creative.md) and
  [Upload a Hosted Video Creative](upload-a-hosted-video-creative.md).

## Campaign targeting

- Category targeting is possible for video, but it is not reflected in
  reporting.

- You can target Google Ad Manager inventory by position, but it is NOT
  recommended. In the **Video** section
  under **Targeting**, leave the default
  **Any position** selected.

  For more information about video targeting, see
  [Video Targeting](video-targeting.md). (For Deals targeting, see
  [Video Player Targeting](video-player-targeting.md))
