# Microsoft Monetize - Daypart targeting

You can target users based on the day and time when they see
impressions. In the **Budgeting and
Scheduling** section of an ALI, click the pencil icon next to
**Daypart**.

By default, all days and times are targeted. On the
**Daypart Targeting** dialog, you can
narrow your targeting by drawing the blocks of time during which you
want to reach users. Also, you can define whether targeting should be
based on each user's timezone (as determined by the user's browser) or
by a specific timezone, regardless of user.

> [!TIP]
> Once you've drawn a box, you can drag the lower right corner to adjust the width and height of the box to cover the days and times desired. Overlapping and adjacent daypart boxes will be merged automatically.
