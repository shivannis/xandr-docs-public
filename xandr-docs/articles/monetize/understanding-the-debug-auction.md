# Microsoft Monetize - Understanding the debug auction

To understand what is happening behind the scenes during an auction, you can run a debug auction. This page explains how to run a debug auction and how to read the output you receive.

## Running a debug auction

A debug auction simulates a real auction without actually logging or serving anything and shows the results in your browser. The log shows the impression bus communicating with all active bidders (including Microsoft Advertising) and then shows the member-specific decisioning.

A debug auction can be run using the following calls:

> [!NOTE]
> All debug auction and browser cookie override calls must use secure https protocols. Requests made using http will not generate valid results.

- **Production/Beta Environment:**

    ```
    https://ib.adnxs.com/tt?id=[TAG_ID]&size=[WIDTH]x[HEIGHT]&debug_member=[BUYER_MEMBER_ID]&dongle=[PASSWORD] 
    ```

- **Client-Testing Environment:**

    ```
    https://ib-test.adnxs.com/tt?id=[TAG_ID]&size=[WIDTH]x[HEIGHT]&debug_member=[BUYER_MEMBER_ID]&dongle=[PASSWORD] 
    ```

- **Video Creatives:**

    Make sure to use a **ptv** tag instead of a **tt** tag while running a debug auction for video creatives.

    ```
    https://ib.adnxs.com/ptv?id=[TAG_ID]&debug_member=[BUYER_MEMBER_ID]&dongle=[PASSWORD] 
    ```

### Parameter syntax

| Parameter | Definition |
|---|---|
| `id` | The ID of the placement tag you will run a debug auction for. |
| `size` | Size of the placement to run, used for sizeless tags. |
| `dongle` | The member's unique debug password. |
| `debug_member` | The ID of the member running the debug auction. |

### Optional parameters

| Parameter | Definition |
|---|---|
| `bidder` | The bidder ID. Microsoft Monetize uses bidder ID `2` in production. |
| `referrer` | Simulate the referring URL from which the ad call is coming. |
| `prefer_learn` | Set to "`true`" to force a prefer learn auction. |
| `position` | Overrides fold position. Can be set to "`above`" or "`below`". |
| `age` | Overrides age (integer). |
| `gender` | Overrides gender ("`male`" or "`female`"). |
| `debug_json` | Converts the auction's HTML output to JSON form when set to "`1`" and "`&bidder_only=1`" is appended. |
| `kw_prefix` | Adds keyword parameters for targeting purposes, for example: "`kw_keyname=value1`". |

### Optional geo code parameters

| Parameter | Definition |
|---|---|
| `country` | Overrides a cookie's current country geo code with whatever is passed as a value. For example: "`country=US`". See [here](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/release-notes/2022#geoip-legacy-databases-have-been-retired) for a complete list of country geo codes. |
| `region` | Overrides a cookie's current region (state) geo code with whatever is passed as a value. For example: "`region=NY`". See [here](https://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/misc/region_codes.csv) for a complete list of region (state) geo codes. |
| `city` | Overrides a cookie's current city geo code with whatever is passed as a value. For example: "`city=New York`". |
| `postal` | Overrides a cookie's current postal code with whatever is passed as a value. For example: "`postal=10010`". See [here](https://worldpostalcode.com/) to find a particular postal code. |
| `DMA` | Overrides a cookie's current Designated Market Area (DMA) geo code with whatever is passed as a value. For example: "`DMA=501`". A DMA divides geographical regions by their television and radio markets. |

> [!NOTE]
> If you are trying to spoof a particular region or city, you must include the most general to most specific geographically. For city targeting, you need to include the country, region (state), and city. For example: `&country=US&region=NY&city=New York`. Remember to type out the full city name.

### Example

```
https://ib.adnxs.com/tt?id=3457&debug_member=999&dongle=MyDongle 
https://ib.adnxs.com/tt?id=3457&size=728x90&dongle=MyPassWord&debug_member=999&referrer=https://www.appnexus.com 
```

### Important points

- Placement tag IDs can be found in the UI for your direct inventory, but not for real-time inventory.

- If an item is out of budget, inactive, or in pacing sleep (i.e. it is spending evenly across the day), it will not appear in the log. Generally, refreshing will cause paced objects to appear (because they will have come out of sleep). But heavily paced objects (e.g. spend $5 evenly with no targeting so there's a lot of sleeping between bids) may not appear in the final list of bidding campaigns.

### Override Microsoft Advertising browser cookie

When debugging a particular ad campaign, it may help that your browser's cookie contains or excludes the specific user criteria being targeting (e.g. country or segment). Please see the below table for information on how to view/modify your cookie.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If using the cookie viewer, you must include your member ID and dongle. This ensures you will only see the segments that belong to your member. You can click on the **Debug** button on any placement and to see your member ID and dongle in the querystring.

| Action | URL |
|---|---|
| View Microsoft Advertising cookie | `https://ib.adnxs.com/cookie?member_id=MEMBER_ID&dongle=DONGLE` <br> where `MEMBER_ID` is your member ID, `DONGLE` is your member-specific dongle |
| Add/remove yourself to/from segments | `https://ib.adnxs.com/seg?add=SEGMENT_ID` <br> `https://ib.adnxs.com/seg?remove=SEGMENT_ID` <br> where `SEGMENT_ID` is the ID of the targeted segment |
| Override cookie geography data | `https://ib.adnxs.com/cookie?member_id=MEMBER_ID&dongle=DONGLE&country=COUNTRY&region=REGION&dma=DMA&city=CITY&postal=POSTAL` <br> where `MEMBER_ID` is your member ID, `DONGLE` is your member-specific dongle, `COUNTRY` is the targeted country code, `REGION` is the targeted region code, `DMA` is the targeted numeric metropolitan code, `CITY` is the targeted city name, and `POSTAL` is the targeted postal code <br><br> **Note**: To set city geo, you must set country, region in addition. |

## Interpreting the debug auction log

- This is a sample debug log run by an Ad Network for a placement that it exposed for reselling.
- This particular debug log was run in a deprecated sandbox environment, so URLs are slightly different than they would be in the production server.
- All IDs have been changed to random numbers.

:::image type="content" source="media/debug-auction-payment-rules.png" alt-text="Screenshot of payment rules from a sample debug log.":::

Microsoft Advertising's bidder gives more detailed debug text, beginning with "Debug text from bidder 2" (live). This output includes information such as the bidder version, the region info., and user info. Excerpts from a live debug auction are below:

:::image type="content" source="media/debug-auction-geo-b.png" alt-text="Screenshot of user ID and geographical information from a sample bidder debug text.":::

This debug info continues, including information such as the segments that the user is in and other relevant objects.

:::image type="content" source="media/debug-auction-segments.png" alt-text="Screenshot of segment information from a sample bidder debug text.":::

> [!NOTE]
> This section highlights the decisions made by the bidder.

The debug auction then prints a table with the headings of Advertiser, Line Item, Campaign (if applicable), Detail, and Result. This is the most important part of the debug auction output as it will tell you why you may not be bidding on impressions for this tag; or if they are, how much they would bid.

After all ad campaigns are evaluated, you will see the summary table.

:::image type="content" source="media/debug-auction-summary-table.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the summary table from a sample debug auction.":::

You will also see the performance summary.

:::image type="content" source="media/performance-summary.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the performance summary from a sample debug auction.":::

You will receive an output of all bids and final bids. RTB buyers will see the value of the bid, the brand ID, and the learn type.

:::image type="content" source="media/final-bids.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the final bids table from a sample debug auction.":::

> [!NOTE]
> This debug log will also compare the result of Microsoft Advertising's bidder with the result any other bidders participating in the auction, looking for the winner and the second highest price (since Microsoft Advertising uses Second Price Auction).

Finally, we show the highest net bid, and the member and creative that would have served had this not been a debug auction.

## Running a test auction

In addition to debug auctions, which simulate real auctions without logging or serving ads, you can also run a test auction. Test auctions are designed to allow clients to test if their ads are being delivered as expected and verify that everything is configured correctly.

Like a debug auction, in a test auction Microsoft Advertising does not transact the impression; no one will be paid or billed, nothing is logged, and no ads will be served. In addition, in a test auction, the actual content of the ad being sent is ignored; even if a banned creative is sent, a test auction will not result in an IP being blocked.

To run a test auction, add the `test=1` parameter to an ad call; for example:

```
https://ib.adnxs.com/tt?id=1234&test=1 
```

If the ad is visible in a browser, the configuration is valid.
