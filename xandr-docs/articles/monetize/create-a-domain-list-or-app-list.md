# Create a domain list or app list

> [!NOTE]
> Targeting lists are only available to Standard Line Items. For an overview of which targeting options are available to Standard versus Augmented Line items, see [Buy-Side Targeting](buy-side-targeting.md).

You can create a new domain list or app list by uploading a text file, or by entering domains or apps manually into Monetize. This page walks you through the process. For details about creating a list by duplicating an existing list, see [Explore Domain Lists or App Lists](explore-domain-lists-or-app-lists.md).

## Create a domain list

> [!NOTE]
> Domain targeting applies only to **Web** and **Mobile Web** impressions and does not apply to **Mobile App** impressions. If you have allowed your campaign to serve on mobile apps while targeting a domain list, the campaign will be unrestricted when buying mobile app inventory unless you have also applied App List targeting. To avoid serving on mobile app inventory, switch the **Apps Placements** toggle in your campaign's targeting profile to OFF.

1. Go to **Network** > **Inventory** > **Targeting Lists**.
1. Click **Create New** > **Domain List** OR select the **Domain Lists** tab and click **+ New**.
1. In the **New Domain List** dialog, enter the **Name** and **Description** of the domain list.
1. In the **Domains** section, either:
    - Select **Enter text** and copy and paste domains into the text area OR
    - Select **Upload a file**, click **Select File**, and select text file to upload.
        > [!NOTE]
        > Excel files are not allowed.
1. Click **Save**. To target this domain list in a campaign, see [Domain Targeting](domain-targeting.md).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Domains and subdomains must be separated by a comma, space, or line break. See below for [examples for domains and subdomains formatting](#examples-for-domains-and-subdomains-formatting).
> - Wildcards (for example, `msn.*`) are not allowed in domain lists.
>   However, a top-level domain (TLD) can be added to a domain list by
>   entering it into the domain list text field without leading periods.
>   For example, to block the `.fr` domain, add `fr` without the period to
>   the list.
> - To restrict or include an entire TLD, enter that TLD in your list. Do
>   not include the leading period "." For example, if you want to serve
>   on any site in the `.de` TLD, you should add `de` (with no leading
>   period) to your allowlist.
> - You can only target domains (`test4.com`) or sub-domains
>   (`review.test4.com`); you can't target specific directories within
>   domains. For example, targeting `test4.com/review` is not supported.
> - If you target a domain, it automatically targets all subdomains. For
>   example, targeting `test4.com` automatically targets
>   `review.test4.com.`
> - Domains which begin with `"www"` will have the `"www"` substring
>   stripped out before being stored in our system. For example,
>   `"www.example.org"` will be shortened to `"example.org"`.

### Examples for domains and subdomains formatting

Examples of acceptable formatting include:

- ```
  test1.com,review.test2.com,test3.com
  ```

- ```
  test1.com review.test2.com test3.com
  ```

- ```
  test1.com
  review.test2.com
  test3.com
  ```

- ```
  test1.com,
  review.test2.com,
  test3.com
  ```

## Create an app list

1. Go to **Network** > **Inventory** > **Targeting Lists**.
1. Click **Create New** > **App List** OR select the **App Lists** tab and click **+ New**.
1. In the **New App List** dialog, enter the **Name** and **Description** of the app list.
1. In the **Apps** section, either:
    - Select **Enter text** and copy and paste app IDs into the text area OR
    - Select **Upload a file**, click **Select File**, and select text file with app IDs to upload.

      > [!NOTE]
      > The app IDs should be separated by commas or line breaks.

1. Click **Save**. To target this app list in a campaign, see [App Targeting](app-targeting.md).

### App bundle ID (App ID)

An app bundle ID (or app ID) is just a unique identifier for a specific app. App IDs are defined differently depending on whether the app runs on iOS or Android:

- Every iOS app has a unique iTunes ID
- Every Android app has a unique Android Package Name

### How to find app IDs

To find the IDs for an Android or IOS app, find the app's detail page - the easiest way is to do a web search. The URL of the app store's detail page will show the app's ID.

For example, here are the detail pages for the "Candy Crush" app:

- Google Play: `https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.king.candycrushsaga`
  - ID: com.king.candycrushsaga
- iTunes: `https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id553834731`
  - ID: 553834731

### How to choose which apps to target

To identify specific mobile apps to target, we recommend targeting the region you're interested in, activating your campaign, and after a few days running the [Site Domain Performance](site-domain-performance.md) report, which will show you the apps that you've been reaching. You can then update your campaign targeting to include or exclude specific apps to meet your needs.
