# Microsoft Monetize - Seller fill and delivery publisher report

The Seller Fill and Delivery Report was designed as a troubleshooting
tool to provide sellers granular information regarding all impressions
sent to Microsoft Advertising and to help diagnose delivery
issues all the way down to the tag and domain level. Using the new
descriptive fields, it is possible to see an approximation of overall
fill rate on Microsoft Advertising using the "Total Ad
Responses" and "Total Ad Requests" metrics. This report provides
guidance on areas to troubleshoot but should not be used as a source of
truth for billing or transacted impressions.

> [!NOTE]
> This report only provides directional guidance on potential areas to troubleshoot. Figures in this report might see slight discrepancies with other standard reports, including the Network Analytics Report and the Video Analytics Report. 
>
> We recommend viewing each report independently and not comparing the directional figures from the Seller Fill and Delivery Report with other Microsoft Advertising reporting, to avoid unnecessary confusion.

The data contained in this report will help pinpoint issues contributing
to untransacted impressions stemming from:

- Improper default/passback tag setup
- Inventory blocklists related to IP or domain blocking
- Video player errors
- Miscellaneous causes

> [!NOTE]
> **For video sellers only:** As a result of video caching by video players, the Microsoft Advertising data pipeline allows a six-hour window to register a response from a video player after the auction is complete and the creative VAST XML has been sent to the page, before considering a video impression 'non-responsive' (Bid Sent No Response).
>
> Microsoft Advertising will update some counts, for video tags only, six hours after the time of the auction. Therefore, to receive the most accurate view of video counts across dimensions, schedule your reports to run after the six-hour window for a given hour of data.

The diagram below is a representation of how metrics are grouped and

## To run your report

Follow these steps to run your report.

1. Select **Reporting** from the
    appropriate top menu (depending on how your account has been
    configured).
    1. Or, from the Publishers top menu, click on
        **Prebid Server Premium** \> **Analytics** \> **Prebid Server Analytics**.
1. Select the relevant report from the list. The
    **Report** screen shows the available
    filters, dimensions, and delivery options for the report. The
    selections you make here will determine what report data is
    delivered to you, and how.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For an explanation of how grouping and filtering work, see [Dimensions, Metrics, Filtering, and Grouping](dimensions-metrics-filtering-and-grouping.md).
    
1. Select the relevant filters to limit the data displayed to just the
    information you want. For example, rather than running a report that
    shows impressions for all inventory sources, you may want to list
    results for just a select few. When you select a filter (by clicking
    **Edit**), a selection panel appears.
    Select items in the **Available** list (left), then click
    **Add** to include them in the
    **Chosen** list (right).
1. Group by Dimension. Grouping allows you to display rows of data in
    the order you prefer.

    > [!WARNING]
    > The more dimensions you group by, the larger the data set that is returned. Larger data sets can take substantially longer to process. Be sure to group using only the dimensions you need.

1. Choose a delivery option. Once you've selected your filters and
    grouped by your chosen dimensions, you need to choose a delivery
    method. Available delivery methods include:
    - **Run now, show results in screen**: For smaller amounts of data,
      you may want to view the report as soon as possible in your
      browser. You can download the report in XLSX, CSV, Excel/TSV and
      JSON format. However, there is a limit of 100,000 rows per report
      when downloading as XLSX and Excel file.
    - **Run in background, notify me when results are ready to view**: A
      popup notification will let you know when the report is ready to
      view or download.
