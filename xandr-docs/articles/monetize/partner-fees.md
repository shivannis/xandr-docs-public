# Microsoft Monetize - Partner fees

If you need to reserve a portion of your budget for third-party costs--costs owed to parties other than the publisher--you can define this information with partner fees. Fees can be tracked on a CPM, cost share, or revenue share basis, and can be applied to multiple advertisers and line items, if desired. A single line item or advertiser can have multiple fees applied.

Common fees you might need to budget for are:

- Advertiser **ad serving fees** and **creative hosting fees**, which are charged for delivering a line item's creative assets.

- **Data fees** that are not cleared by Microsoft Advertising as part of the Data Marketplace.

- Post-bid **reporting fees** - for example, using a pixel to track where impressions are served and then auditing retroactively how many transactions violated brand safety standards.

- **Revenue share agreements** with other ad tech partners.

- **Incremental fees** charged by an intermediary to the advertiser, such as a managed service fee or consulting fee.
