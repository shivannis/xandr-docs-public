# Microsoft Monetize - View line item details (SMW)

The Line Items Details window lets you view and edit line item settings and access troubleshooting tools, essential metrics, performance visualizations, and associated line item objects.

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Monetize Monitoring feature is in **Open Beta** and currently only supports deal line items, augmented line items (ALI), and guaranteed delivery augmented line items (GDALI). It is subject to change without notice and is only available to select clients.

## Access line item details

From the **Line Items** window:

1. Select the appropriate progress tab (**All**, **Upcoming**, **In Progress**, or **Completed**). See [Monitor Line Items](monitor-line-items.md) for more information.
1. Click anywhere in the row of the line item you want to see details on.

   > [!NOTE]
