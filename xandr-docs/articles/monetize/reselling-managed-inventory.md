# Reselling managed inventory


In addition to selling your publishers' inventory to managed
advertisers, you can also resell to the entire
Microsoft Advertising platform. This section of the
documentation will provide an overview of reselling-related settings, as
well as offer instructions for how to configure your inventory for
reselling.

Inventory can be made targetable at the network and publisher levels. It
can only be made buyable at the placement group level.

Therefore, in order to allow buyers to target and purchase your
inventory, you must take the following actions:

- **Expose inventory for targeting by buyers:** This is also known as
  "reselling exposure", and can be done for the entire network or
  per-publisher. This makes it targetable. For instructions, see [Managing Your Inventory Reselling Exposure](managing-your-inventory-reselling-exposure.md) and
  "Step 7. Choose the exposure settings" in [Create a Publisher](create-a-publisher.md).
- **Enable placement groups (and all of their placements) for resale:**
  In order to be resold to other members, a placement group must be
  enabled for resale by setting it to participate in the RTB
  Marketplace. This makes it buyable. For instructions on how to toggle
  this setting, see [Create a Placement Group](create-a-placement-group.md).
