# Microsoft Monetize - Managing user logins and permissions

The pages mentioned in this section describe how to create and manage your users, set up their passwords and permissions.

With the consolidation of Microsoft Advertising to the Microsoft family, we have integrated the authentication process of the users (who are using Microsoft Advertising products) to the Microsoft Identity Platform. The profound advantage of this integration is that users are able to access Microsoft Advertising applications using the same sign-on methods to access other Microsoft products. Additionally, the integration to the Microsoft Identity Platform enables new and more secure methods of authentication, powered by Microsoft.

For more details, visit [Microsoft Identity Platform Login](microsoft-identity-platform-login.md).
