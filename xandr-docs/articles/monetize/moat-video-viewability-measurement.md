# Microsoft Monetize - Moat video viewability measurement

You can improve video viewability analytics by linking a hosted video
creative to Moat's viewability measurement and reporting (also known as
**Moat Attention Metrics**). To do so, you must link your account with
Moat and opt in via Microsoft Monetize UI. Through
this integration, if you are an existing Moat client, you can measure
Moat's attention metrics for your video creatives. If you are not a Moat
client, you can still activate Moat measurement. However, you will need
to reach out to Moat in order to view their measurement data. To know
more about Moat measurement, you can visit [this link](https://www.oracle.com/cx/advertising/measurement/).

> [!NOTE]
> - In order to get started with Moat tracking, fill out [this form](https://moat.com/account/signup).
> - As of now Moat integration is only available on desktop and mobile supply types.
> - To link your Microsoft Advertising account with your Moat account you must contact a Moat representative. They may request your Microsoft Advertising member ID or seat ID.

This guide explains the process of enabling Moat Attention Metrics for
your video creative.

## For a new video creative

Integration with Moat's reporting is a seamless step in the process of
uploading a new creative. Follow the below steps to do the needful:

- Select your Advertiser and go to
  **Creative Manager** screen.
- Click on **New** drop-down and select
  **Video** from the list to create a new
  video creative.
- In **Video Creative: Create New
  screen**, you can
  - either upload a video file under
    **Hosted File** section. You can
    upload the video file by dragging it onto the area labeled
     **Drop File Here To Upload** or by
    clicking the **Select File** button
    and browsing through your files. For more information about the
    steps involved in this setup, check out [Upload a
    Hosted Video Creative](upload-a-hosted-video-creative.md).
  - or enter the link for a video under
    **Third-Party URL** section and
    click **Continue**.
- Once the file is uploaded, you will find the
  **Moat Attention Metrics** checkbox
  under **Verification**  section of
  **Pixels (optional)** panel. Check
  the **Moat Attention Metrics** checkbox
  to include metrics about this creative in your Moat dashboard.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > You will find **Microsoft Advertising - Viewability** checkbox is disabled, because Microsoft Advertising video viewability measurement runs automatically.

- After this initial setup, all data associated with your
  Microsoft Advertising creatives will automatically flow into
  your Moat account.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > The data collected may take up to 24 hours to populate your Moat dashboard.

 ## For an existing video creative

Existing hosted video creatives can also be linked to **Moat Attention
Metrics**. Find the Moat Attention
Metrics checkbox by navigating to the
**Creative Manager**, select your
creative and click on the **Full Edit**
button. The checkbox is under
**Verification**  section of
**Pixels (optional)** panel. Check the
box to include metrics about this creative in your Moat dashboard.

## Post setup

After you launch your creative, get in touch with Moat representative to
setup a new tile within the Moat reporting interface. Once you've
completed this one time setup, your tile will capture and display Moat
metrics for all of the Microsoft Advertising creatives you setup
with Moat's tracking enabled.

At any point of time in future, if you want to disable Moat metrics,
follow the steps mentioned in **For an existing video creative** section
above and uncheck the **Moat Attention
Metrics** checkbox for the creative.
