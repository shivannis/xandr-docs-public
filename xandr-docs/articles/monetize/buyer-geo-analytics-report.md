# Microsoft Monetize - Buyer geo analytics report

The **Buyer Geo Analytics** report allows you to break down delivery and
performance by geographic area. Sample use cases for this report
include:

- Buyers who would like to optimize their ad campaigns
- Buyers who need to report to their client advertisers or agencies on
  line item or campaign delivery by geo

This report can break down performance along the following geographic
boundaries:

- **Country**: The user's [Country](../digital-platform-api/country-service.md).
- **Region/State**: The user's [Region](../digital-platform-api/region-service.md), e.g., Baja California or
  California.
- **Metro Code**: The user's [Metro Code](../digital-platform-api/designated-market-area-service.md).
- **Political Districts**: The user's [Political District](../digital-platform-api/political-district-service.md) (US Only).

For more information on the available data fields and their definitions,
see [Dimensions](#dimensions) and [Metrics](#metrics) below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is a limitation to how accurate the geo data is, particularly on impressions bought from external supply partners. Since some external supply partners (such as Google Ad Manager) truncate the last octet of the user's IP, we have a less precise IP to use when performing an IP geo-lookup. As a result, our geo data may not always be completely accurate at granular levels (such as region and metro code) for impressions bought from these supply sources.

## Dimensions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Filter?** column below shows whether a dimension can be used as a filter as well as being used to group by.

| Column | Filter? | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Advertiser | Yes | The advertiser name and ID, in the format "Great Advertiser (456)". |
| Buying Currency | No | The transaction currency used by the buyer to purchase this impression. |
| Campaign | Yes | The campaign name and ID associated with the auction, in the format "South Texas Ford Drivers (123)". (Does not apply to all advertisers.) |
| Campaign Code | No | The custom code for the campaign. |
| City | No | The city in which the user is located. |
| Congressional District | Yes | The Congressional District of the user's location |
| Country | Yes | The country of the user's location, both name and code, in the format "France (FR)". The string "250" can appear in cases where we don't know the country or if the country doesn't map correctly to a location in our database. |
| Insertion Order | Yes | The insertion order name and ID, in the format "Midwest Winter Getaways (789)". |

The string "unknown values (-1)" can appear in cases where we don't know the metro code or if the metro code doesn't map correctly to a location in our database.<br>**Note**: Our reporting derives metro codes from the city logged for the auction. However, our geo provider is sometimes unable to determine a city from the IP address associated with the impression, even when the metro code **is** determined. Therefore, there are cases where a line item or campaign targeting a specific metro code has impressions in reporting showing a metro code of 1. |
| Postal Code | No | The postal (zip) code in which the user is located. |
| Region | Yes | The region or state name and country code of the user's location, in the format "Baden-Wurttemberg (DE)". The string "4192" can appear in cases where we don't know the region/state or if the region/state doesn't map correctly to a location in our database. |
| Split | Yes | The name and ID of the split that purchased the impressions in this data set. Splits are only applicable to augmented line items. For any rows with a campaign name, the **Split** column (if included) will be null. |
| State House District | Yes | The State House District of the user's location |
| State Senate District | Yes | The State Senate District of the user's location |
| UK Constituent Country | No | The Constituent Country of the user's location. This is applicable for United Kingdom. Possible values include:<br> - England<br>- Scotland<br> - Wales<br> - Northern Ireland |

## How to run your report

Follow these steps to run your report.

1. Select **Reporting** from the
    appropriate top menu (depending on how your account has been
    configured).
    1. Or, from the Publishers top menu, click on
        **Prebid
        Server Premium** \>
        **Analytics** \>
        **Prebid Server Analytics**
1. Select the relevant report from the list. The
    **Report** screen shows the available
    filters, dimensions, and delivery options for the report. The
    selections you make here will determine what report data is
    delivered to you, and how.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > For an explanation of how grouping and filtering work, see [Dimensions, Metrics, Filtering, and Grouping](dimensions-metrics-filtering-and-grouping.md).

1. Select the relevant filters to limit the data displayed to just the
    information you want. For example, rather than running a report that
    shows impressions for all inventory sources, you may want to list
    results for just a select few. When you select a filter (by clicking
    **Edit**), a selection panel appears.
    Select items in the **Available** list (left), then click
    **Add** to include them in the
    **Chosen** list (right).
1. Group by Dimension. Grouping allows you to display rows of data in
    the order you prefer.

    > [!WARNING]
    > The more dimensions you group by, the larger the data set that is returned. Larger data sets can take substantially longer to process. Be sure to group using only the dimensions you need.

1. Choose a delivery option. Once you've selected your filters and
    grouped by your chosen dimensions, you need to choose a delivery
    method. Available delivery methods include:
    - **Run now, show results in screen**: For smaller amounts of data,
      you may want to view the report as soon as possible in your
      browser. You can download the report in XLSX, CSV, Excel/TSV and
      JSON format. However, there is a limit of 100,000 rows per report
      when downloading as XLSX and Excel file.
    - **Run in background, notify me when results are ready to view**: A
      popup notification will let you know when the report is ready to
      view or download.

      > [!TIP]
      > The maximum size of the report that can be downloaded from the UI is 100 MB. Also, there is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when downloading as XLSX and Excel file. If the size of the report is more than that, you can try to download it using the [API](../digital-platform-api/report-service.md) for that reporting service (The limit here is 10 million rows).

    - <span id="ID-00009687__d10e107">**Export, send results via
      email**: Run the report in the background and email the results to
      one or more email addresses.
    - **Save as report template**: Save your selected report settings so
      that you can run this report again in the future. You can name
      this template using the text entry field under
      **Name this report** (its checkbox
      is auto-selected when you choose this option). A saved report can
      be rerun from the **Your Reports**
      screen.
    - **Add to scheduled reports**: Run this report automatically at
      specified times and have it sent to one or more email addresses.
    - **Name this report**: Give this report with its current settings a
      name for future reference.
1. Click **Run report** to send your report request.
