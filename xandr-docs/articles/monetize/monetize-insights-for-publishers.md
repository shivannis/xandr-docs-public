# Monetize insights for publishers

Monetize Insights delivers actionable data for publishers directly
within the Microsoft Monetize UI. It helps
publishers to save time by removing the need to configure reporting
dashboards or rely on in-depth reporting to access high level inventory
information.

## Demand channels

These are clickable navigation tiles. It shows revenue for the last 7
days as compared to 7 days prior to it:

- **Overall Revenue**
- **Deals**
- **Open Exchange**
- **Curation**

**Specific insights for the channel**

Selecting a channel in **Demand
Channels** will show the insights for that specific demand in the
navigation tiles.

## Global filters

Filter applies to everything on the screen. It filters by
**Publisher**,
**Placement group** and
**Media type**. It saves your
selection and next time when you open the page, it shows last selected
options. To undo your selection, click clear all.

## Global settings

Global Settings has two fields under it:

- **Currency**
- **Date**

The date has been fixed to 7 days view and 7 days prior to that.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, these settings are under development and are unselectable.

## Ad quality

**Ad Quality** shows revenue-impacting
blocks to help in identifying and evaluating opportunities to adjust ad
quality settings. **Ad Quality** contains controls for brand safety, technical attributes and other
parameters that can act to block a bid in the auction.

> [!NOTE]
> As an organization, we recommend you to regularly view your Ad Quality settings (at least quarterly) to make sure that are appropriate and consistent with settings configured in the other SSPs (that you may also be using to monetize inventory). Generally, the blocked bid value overestimates potential revenue impact and is influenced by the price and frequency of the bids that have been blocked.

The value displayed on **Ad Quality**
tab is the sum of all blocked bid prices. For example, a $5.8m of
blocked bid value in last 7 days, up 11% compared to prior week shows
that bids with that value have been blocked. This can be used to
directionally assess magnitude of potential revenue opportunities. The
11% increase could be seen as significant and warrant further
investigation by using the Ad Quality tab to understand if a specific
bid rejection is causing this increase.

Quality**, go to [Ad Quality](monetize-insights-ad-quality.md).

## Deals

**Deals** tab specifies the most
significant bid rejections by a deal. This tab helps to:

- Sort by total bid value, absolute and percentage changes easily.
- Show the inventory the blocks are occurring on, and the overall
  rejection history.

## Demand issues

**Demand Issues** tab contains bid
rejections that are generally caused by buyer behavior. This tab helps
to:

- Show issues for a buyer on specific publishers.
- Include issue resolution help, time-series chart, and creative
  preview.

Issues**, go to [Demand Issues](monetize-insights-demand-issues.md).

## Floor rules

**Floor Rules** tab displays blocks
created due to your Yield Management settings. This tab helps to:

- Display the value of bids being blocked by each floor along with the
  change between the current and comparison period.
- See the trends for blocks and how specific buyers are impacted.
