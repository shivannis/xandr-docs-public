# Troubleshoot line items

The **Troubleshooting** tab of the **Line Item Details** window provides troubleshooting information and tools for the selected line item in the **Impression Funnel**, **Troubleshooting Reports**, and **Bid Request Sampler** sections.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Microsoft Monetize Monitoring feature is in **Open Beta** and currently only supports deal line items, augmented line items (ALI), and guaranteed delivery augmented line items (GDALI). It is subject to change without notice and is only available to select clients.

The **Troubleshooting** window is available when a line item is selected from the **Line Items** window (see [Monitor Line Items](monitor-line-items.md) for more information).

To access the **Troubleshooting** window:

1. On the **Line Items** window, select the appropriate progress tab (**All**, **Upcoming**, **In Progress**, or **Completed**).

    See [Monitor Line Items](monitor-line-items.md) for more information.

1. Click anywhere in the row of the line item you want to troubleshoot to open the **Line Item Details** window.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can search for line items by line item name, line item ID, deal name, or deal ID.

1. On the **Line Item Details** window, click the **Troubleshooting** tab to open the **Troubleshooting** window.

    You can now select the following expandable **Troubleshooting** sections:
    - **Impression Funnel** - provides detailed metrics, graphs, and suggestions to resolve issues. See [Impression Funnel](impression-funnel.md) for more information.
    - **Troubleshooting Reports** - provides easy access to the most common reports for troubleshooting. See [Troubleshooting Reports](troubleshooting-reports.md) for more information.
