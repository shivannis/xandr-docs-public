# Update a domain list or App list

> [!NOTE]
> Targeting lists are only available to Standard Line Items. For an overview of which targeting options are available to Standard versus Augmented Line items, see [Buy-Side Targeting](buy-side-targeting.md).

You can add, remove, or overwrite a domain list or app list. You can
also change the name and/or description of the list.

> [!WARNING]
> Before you proceed, note that changing a domain or app list immediately impacts any campaigns already targeting the list. This could result in incorrect targeting. It's a good idea to make sure you're aware of all the campaigns that could be affected before making changes to your targeting lists. If you change only the name or description of a list, any campaigns using it will be unaffected.

## Domain lists

> [!NOTE]
> Domain targeting applies only to **Web** and **Mobile Web** impressions and does not apply to **Mobile App** impressions. If you have allowed your campaign to serve on mobile apps while targeting a domain list, the campaign will be unrestricted when buying mobile app inventory unless you have also applied App List targeting. To avoid serving on mobile app inventory, switch the **Apps Placements** toggle in your campaign's targeting profile to OFF. Domains which begin with `"www"` will have the `"www"` substring stripped out before being stored in our system. For example,`"www.example.org"` will be shortened to `"example.org"`.
