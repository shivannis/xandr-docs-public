# Microsoft Monetize - Explore insertion orders

The **Insertion Orders** screen shows you essential metrics about all insertion orders under a specific advertiser, provides quick access to each insertion order's details, and
reporting options.

This document describes the Insertion Order screen for individual advertisers.

Things you can do on this page include:

- Navigate to insertion orders quickly using filters
- See performance metrics
- Drill down into line items to configure or troubleshoot
- Create and edit insertion orders

## Get to the insertion orders screen

To get to the insertion orders screen:

- On the **Advertisers** screen, find the advertiser for which you want to view insertion orders and click the button in the **Ins Orders** column.
- In **Advertiser's Details** view, click on **Insertion Orders**.

## Filter your insertion orders

The **Advanced Filters** menu lets you filter for insertion orders based on Advertiser, State, Type, Insertion Order Name, Flight Start and End Date, and External Code. Click on **Apply** or **Apply and Save As**. The **Apply and Save As** option will save your filter for future purpose.

## View stats

The metrics on the **Insertion Orders** screen help you quickly assess the performance and delivery of your insertion orders. These metrics are faster and more readily accessed
than standard reporting data. They are cached on a regular basis and are shown whenever you open the **Insertion Orders** screen.

Note that these stats may not match the data from standard reporting exactly for technical reasons. For more information, see [Availability of Reporting Data](availability-of-reporting-data.md).
