> This feature is part of a functionality that is currently in **Beta**. It is still under development and may be subject to change without notice. Contact your Microsoft Advertising Account Representative to get enabled.

**Ad Quality** shows revenue-impacting
blocks to help identify and evaluate opportunities to adjust ad quality
settings. They are settings that the publisher has for brand safety. It
gets configured when the client joins our platform and then may not be
re-evaluated frequently. In the **Ad Quality** tab:

- **Creative Preview** lives directly
  in the side panel for quick review.
- there are direct links to rule management settings.

> [!NOTE]
> As an organization, we recommend you to regularly view your Ad Quality settings (at least quarterly) to make sure that are appropriate and consistent with settings configured in the other SSPs (that you may also be using to monetize inventory). Generally, the blocked bid value overestimates potential revenue impact and is influenced by the price and frequency of the bids that have been blocked.

> [!NOTE]
> If an Ad Quality (AQ) is set as `default_brand_status:banned` but the parent brand is set as `status:trusted`, the child brand overrides the setting in `default_brand_status` and it will be able to serve unless it is explicitly banned in the Ad Profile's brand override list.

## Ad quality summary

The value mentioned on **Ad Quality** tab
is the blocked bid value. A $5.8M of blocked bid value in last 7 days,
up 11% compared to prior week does not provide a direct revenue number
but can be used directionally to assess opportunities.

## Filter

Clicking on **Filter** next to
**Ad Quality** will display a small window
with following fields:

## Quickly get a sense of relative impact and trends

The chart helps you to quickly examine issues in aggregate to decide
where to focus.

## Overview

There are three dropdowns which decide how your chart appears depending
on your selection:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Compare relative scale and observe trends | View as a bar chart to compare how the metrics compare between the grouping you have selected. You can also view as an area chart to see how the groupings changed over time. It specifies if there are spikes or consistent behaviour. |
| How you want the data grouped | Focuses on how you want the data to be grouped. Grouping can be done on the basis of Publisher, Ad quality rule, Rejection type, Bid rejection, Media type or Placement group. |
| Which metric is of interest | To get the metric of interest, choose between Blocked bid value, Error count and Avg CPM. |

## Bid rejections table

The table contains rejections that are grouped according to different
publishers. Below are the different columns that appear on the table:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| % Δ Blocked Bid Value | The percentage change of the blocked bid value week over week. Sort by this value to see the biggest relative changes between time periods. |
| Ad Quality Rule | What type of creative is it, and where is it being blocked within your inventory. |
| Avg CPM | The average bid price of the rejections. |
| Bid Rejection Name | This is the specific block reason. For example, if brand Fizzy Drinks is blocked due to its brand, the name of the brand will show here. |
| Bid Rejection Type | The general reason for the block, such as Technical Attribute, Category or Brand. |
| Blocked Bid Value | The sum of all bid prices. Directional to gauge potential impact. Incremental bid value to existing revenue and multiple bids not accounted for. |
| Error Count | The total number of bid rejections resulting from Ad Quality Rules. |
| Media Type | Native, Banner or Video creative. |
| Publisher | An object within our system to group inventory, normally by publication. |
| Δ Blocked Bid Value | The change in dollars of the Blocked Bid Value in the last 7 days compared to 7 days prior to it. Sort by this value to see the biggest changes between time periods. |
