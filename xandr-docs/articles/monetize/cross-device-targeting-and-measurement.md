# Microsoft Monetize - Targeting and measurement (Cross-Device)

Cross-device targeting and measurement, which can be enabled at the line
item level, ties together events or actions for a unique individual that
occur on different devices.

By tracking and managing each individual user's ad viewing and
conversion experience across the various devices they use, advertisers
can deliver a holistic brand experience to consumers and more accurately
measure the impact of ad spending on driving conversions.

Cross-device capability enhances targeting and attribution using
information from an identity graph, a database of customer information
that allows Microsoft Advertising to identify users on multiple devices. Supported
identity graphs are:

- Microsoft Advertising's identity graph, which covers the
  United States and Europe. The Microsoft Advertising United
  States and Europe graphs are powered by market-leading data partners.
  
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > European cross device coverage is currently limited to the following key countries:
  > - France
  > - Italy
  > - Germany
  > - Great Britain
  > - Spain
  > - Switzerland
  > - Austria
  > - Belgium
  > - United Kingdom

- Tapad's graph, which combines curated data with machine learning.

> Cross-device audience targeting for CTV devices is only available in the United States.
