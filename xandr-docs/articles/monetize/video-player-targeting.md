# Video player targeting

> [!NOTE]
> This topic applies to Deals. For non-Deals line items, see [Video Targeting](video-targeting.md).

You can target video inventory based on the playback method, player size, position, creative duration, and framework.

In the **Targeting** section of a line item or campaign, click the **Edit** button next to **Video**.

You can target video creatives in any or all of the following ways:

- [Target video inventory by position](video-player-targeting.md#target-video-inventory-by-position-or-context)
- [Target video inventory by playback method](video-player-targeting.md#target-video-inventory-by-playback-method)
- [Target video invemtory by player width](video-player-targeting.md#target-video-inventory-by-player-width)
- [Target video inventory by framework](video-player-targeting.md#target-video-inventory-by-framework)
- [Target video inventory by creative duration](video-player-targeting.md#target-video-inventory-by-creative-duration)

> [!NOTE]
> You should avoid using both VAST creatives and in-banner or interstitial video creatives within the same video campaign. An in-banner or interstitial video creative will not serve when you target by position. Setting any of the three video targeting parameters (i.e., **Playback Method**, **Player Size**, or **Position**) will restrict inventory to only those that satisfy the specified parameters and thus significantly limit your delivery potential.
>
> By default, you will target all playback methods, player sizes, roll positions, allowed creative durations, and video frameworks. However, you can narrow your targeting.

## Target video inventory by position or context

The options available to target inventory by position, also called context:

- **Instream** - Video ads are embedded within a video player.
  - **Pre-roll** - Inventory that hosts video creatives that play before the user selected video of choice.
  - **Mid-roll** - Inventory that hosts video creatives that play in the middle of the user selected video of choice.
  - **Post-roll** - Inventory that hosts video creatives that play after the user selected video of choice.
  - **No roll position defined** - Target inventory where no position information has been provided.
- **Outstream** - Video ads are embedded within the body of a web page.

## Target video inventory by playback method

You can target inventory that accepts creatives with the following playback methods:

- **Auto-play, sound on** - Video creative starts playing with sound on as soon as the page loads.
- **Auto-play, sound off** - Video creative starts playing with sound off as soon as the page loads. Sound comes on when the user clicks on the creative.
- **Auto-play, sound unknown** - Video creative starts playing as soon as the page loads, but no sound information is specified.
- **Click-to-play** - Video creative is static on the page till the user clicks to play.
- **Mouse-over** - Video starts playing when the user moves the mouse over the creative.
- **No playback method provided** - Target inventory where no initiation method information is provided (e.g., YouTube inventory).

  > [!NOTE]
  > - For maximum delivery and reach, we recommend that you include **No initiation method provided** in your targeting since some inventory (such as Google Ad Manager) is not classified.
  > - Playback method targeting is not available for Google Ad Manager (181).

## Target video inventory by player width

Player inventory is available across all supply types (web, mobile web, and app). The following player sizes are available to target:

- **Large -** primarily large-format web and CTV inventory (minimum width of 640 pixels)
- **Medium -** includes most smartphone player inventory for mobile apps (minimum width of 320 pixels, maximum width of 639 pixels)
- **Small -** primarily in-banner inventory (maximum width of 319 pixels)
- **No player width provided**

  > [!TIP]
  > For maximum delivery and reach, we recommend that you include **No player width provided** in your targeting, because some inventory (such as Google Ad Manager) is not classified.

You can either click the graphic to make a selection or check the appropriate checkbox.

## Target video inventory by framework

Publishers set Video Frameworks on the placement or on the query string of the request. You can target Video Frameworks on the deal line item using the expected frameworks of the creatives that will serve through this deal. That way, only impressions with the allowed Video Frameworks will be included. For example, a deal targeting VPAID 2.0 will only
include requests that allow VPAID 2.0 creatives to serve.

You can target the following video frameworks:

- VPAID 1.0
- VPAID 2.0
- MRAID-1
- ORMMA
- MRAID-2

## Target video inventory by creative duration

Publishers set Maximum Creative Duration on the placement or on the query string of the request. You can target creative duration on the deal line item using the expected duration of the creatives that will serve on the deal line item. That way, only impressions with a Maximum Creative Duration higher than the Deal Creative Duration will be included. For example, a deal targeting a creative duration of 60 seconds will only include requests that allow ads of 60 seconds or greater to render.

You can target video inventory by creative duration by specifying the number of seconds duration.
