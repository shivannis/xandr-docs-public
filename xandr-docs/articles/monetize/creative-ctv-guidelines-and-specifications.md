# Microsoft Monetize - Creative CTV guidelines and specifications

To serve on Microsoft Advertising publisher's CTV inventory, your creatives must meet the guidelines and specification requirements, as well as Microsoft Advertising creative standards and any other guidelines that may apply.

If not, you can click **More Details**, to see which requirements need to be adjusted in order to serve on Microsoft Advertising’s premium publisher’s CTV inventory.
