# Associate creatives to campaigns

You can associate creatives to a single campaign or multiple campaigns at once. This page walks you through the process.

## Associate creatives to a single campaign

### Step 1. Select the campaign

On the [Campaigns](explore-campaigns.md) screen, find the campaign to which you want to associate creatives and click the **Creatives** button.

### Step 2. Select the creatives

The **Associated Creatives** dialog shows you the available and selected creatives. Click the check mark for each creative that you want to associate to the campaign and then click **Save**. To preview a creative, click the image icon in the creative row; the creative will appear in the **Preview Creative** pane.

> [!TIP]
> You can use the search field to find a particular creative by name or ID. Also, all active and inactive creatives are listed by default, but you can use the filter to the right of the search field to show just active or inactive creatives.

### Step 3. Save the associations

Click the **Save** button. On the **Campaigns** screen, the **Creatives** column is updated to show the number of creatives associated to the campaign.

## Associate creatives to multiple campaigns

### Step 1. Select the campaigns

On the [Campaigns](explore-campaigns.md) screen, check the box for each campaign to which you want to associate creatives and click
**Actions** > **Associate to Creatives**.

### Step 2. Select the creatives

The **Bulk Associate Creatives** dialog shows you the available creatives. Click the check mark for each creative that you want to associate to the selected campaigns. To preview a creative, click the image icon in the creative row; the creative will appear in the **Preview Creative**.

> [!TIP]
> You can use the search field to find a particular creative by name or ID. Also, all active and inactive creatives are listed by default, but you can use the filter to the right of the search field to show just active or inactive creatives.
> [!WARNING]
> Bulk associating creatives will overwrite any current creative associations for the selected campaigns. Also note that you can associate a single creative to multiple campaigns only if the line items for the campaigns use the same currency.

### Step 3. Save the associations

Click the **Save** button. On the **Campaigns** screen, the **Creatives** column is updated to show the number of creatives associated to the campaigns.
