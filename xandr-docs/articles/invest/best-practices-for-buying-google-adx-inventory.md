# Microsoft Invest - Best practices for buying Google Ad Manager inventory

This page provides recommendations for maximum ad campaign success when targeting Google Ad Manager inventory.

## General

The following are general guidelines to target inventory:

- Create a separate line item targeting Google Ad Manager(181). This is recommended, but not required.
- Make sure to turn off all inventory quality settings by setting your **Inventory Quality** Targeting to **Serve on any inventory**.
- The VAST tag must include the following formats since Google Ad Manager can request any of them on a bid request:
  - H.264 (MP4)
  - FlashVideo (FLV)
  - WebM
- The skip offset must be 5 seconds, otherwise the bid will be filtered out in Google Ad Manager's auction.

## Creative guidelines

The following are guidelines specific to creative standards required for Google Ad Manager:

- Must be SSL compliant. Serving on secure inventory is selected by default. Do NOT make any changes to the setting when you are creating
  a new creative.
- Click the **Run Check** button to have our VAST check scan your XML document. For more details, see [VAST Check](vast-check.md).

  For more information about adding in-stream video creatives, see [Add a Creative](add-a-creative.md) and [Upload a Hosted Video Creative](upload-a-hosted-video-creative.md).

## Campaign targeting

- Category targeting is possible for video, but it is not reflected in reporting.
- You can target Google Ad Manager inventory by position, but it is NOT
  recommended. In the **Video** section under **Targeting**, leave the default
  **Any position** selected.

  For more information about video targeting, see [Video Targeting](video-targeting.md).
