# Political geography targeting

Political geography targeting allows political buyers to target geographies based on legislative district boundaries. Political buyers who support candidates often want to run campaigns based on political geographies, and leveraging political district targeting is a powerful way for buyers to achieve highly granular and precise geographical targeting. The Political Geography Targeting thus plays a key factor in driving performance, as it enables buyers to target the important geographic constructs which is imperative to the buyer's and to their client's successes respectively.

> [!NOTE]
> The feature is available within the existing geo targeting module in Microsoft Invest, and it's called "Political District (US Only)".
