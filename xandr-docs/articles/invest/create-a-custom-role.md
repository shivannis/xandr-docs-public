# Create a custom role in Microsoft Invest

If you need more fine-grained control over how your users access
Microsoft Invest, you can create a custom role.
Custom roles allow you to control what a user sees in
Microsoft Invest so they only see the parts of your
business that you choose.

Custom roles control the actions a user is allowed to take, such as the
ability to view information or full permissions to modify that same
information. For example, you may want an external sales house to have
limited booking and reporting access. This page shows you how to create
a custom role. For more information about roles, see [Working
with Roles](working-with-roles.md).

**Getting There**

-  Select **Network \> User Management \> Roles** from the navigation menu. 
-  Select **Roles** from the top right corner
  under the member (Click on member name to get the dialog).
  
**Create Role**

- From the **Roles** management screen, in the
  **Custom Roles** section, click
   **+New**.
- The **Create Role** screen will appear, where you can choose which permissions this custom role will have along with other details as mentioned below.

**Basic Setup**

- In **Role Name** field, enter a name that will
  help you to identify this role.The name must be unique within your
  Member.
- In **Role Description** field, enter a detailed
  description of the purpose of this role. This field is
  optional.
- In **Feature Roles** field, click
  **Edit Role Links** <br>
    A new dialog **Feature Roles** opens
  to specify feature roles to associate with this custom role.

- Select the feature role(s) to associate with this
  custom role. This field is applicable only if your
  Member has Feature Roles and you want to link
  this custom role to that.
- In **Users** field, click
  **Edit Associated Users**.<br>
  a new dialog **Users** opens to
  specify the users for the role.

- Select the user(s) to link to the custom role who
  will have the permissions specified by the capabilities you assign in
  this role. Alternatively, you can click on
  **Roles** under **Network \> User Management** to go to
  **Roles** screen. There, you can
  click the **pencil** icon to open the
  **Edit Role** dialog and assign
  users. You can also assign an existing role when you create a new
  user. See [Create a User](create-a-user.md) for more information on user settings.
  After you assign a role to a user, it could take up to 10 minutes for
  the new permissions to take effect.

**Capabilities**

- Check the box next to each capability you want
  users who are assigned to this new role to have permission to access.
  Please refer to [Role Capabilities](role-capabilities.md) for more details.

**Landing Page**

- Select a landing page from the dropdown list for
  the custom role. The capabilities for this role will determine where a
  user can begin their session in the application when they first log
  on. All users assigned to this custom role will log in directly to the
  selected landing page. This field is mandatory.
