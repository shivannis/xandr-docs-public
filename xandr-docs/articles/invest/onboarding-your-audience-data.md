# Microsoft Invest - Onboarding your audience data

There are three ways to onboard your audience data:

- [Client-Side Segmentation](client-side-segmentation.md): Allows you to build audience segments by placing
  client-side segment pixels on websites or creatives for simple
  audience targeting strategies.
- [Batch Server-Side Segmentation](../digital-platform-api/batch-server-side-segmentation.md):
  Allows you to batch your users together and add them to segments in
  bulk, via the API.
- [Streaming Server-Side Segmentation](../digital-platform-api/streaming-server-side-segmentation.md):
  This method associates individual users to segments in close to
  real-time, via the API. 

   > [!NOTE]
  > At the moment, this feature is only available to a small group of Alpha testers. It will be released more widely over the course of the next several months.
