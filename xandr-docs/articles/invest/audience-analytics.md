# Audience analytics in Microsoft Invest

You can use the Creative Frequency and Recency report to analyze your
audience at a granular level and the Buyer Reach and Frequency Report to
have an insight on how cross device impacted the number of times a
single person saw the ads across all their devices. Nielsen's Digital Ad
Ratings reports are also available to analyze the audience demographics
that your line item is reaching.

With the [Creative Frequency and Recency Report](creative-frequency-and-recency-report.md), you can view how
often and how frequently users are viewing a specific advertiser's
creatives.

With the [Buyer Reach and Frequency Report](buyer-reach-and-frequency-report.md)
, you can draw meaningful conclusions about the
impact of cross device on conversion use cases.

With the [Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings - Audience Profile Report](nielsen-dar-audience-profile-report.md), you can gain insight
into the audiences (demographics) that your line item has reached.

With the [Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings - Site/Split Report](nielsen-dar-site-split-report.md), you can gain insight into
the publisher domains and audiences connected to your line item's
impressions or views. This report also provides information on your line
item's splits and their performance.
