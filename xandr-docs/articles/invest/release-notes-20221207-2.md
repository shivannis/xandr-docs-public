# December 7, 2022: New feature - Insertion Order (IO) duplication

Insertion Order (IO) Duplication is now available for all Microsoft Invest clients. Save time and manual effort by duplicating an IO with all of its child line items and splits when you need to create similar set ups repeatedly.

For more information, see [Duplicate an Insertion Order](duplicate-an-insertion-order.md).
