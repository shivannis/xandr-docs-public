# Microsoft Invest - Import or export split CSVs

You can create or edit splits in bulk by importing a CSV specifying the details of your splits.

## Import or export a CSV

> [!NOTE]
> When you import a CSV, it replaces all of the existing splits on your line item. To keep targeting the existing splits, they must be specified in the spreadsheet with the same split IDs.

1. Go to **Line Item** > **Programmable Splits**.
1. Click **Actions** > **Import CSV** to import a CSV file or **Actions** > **Export CSV** to export a CSV file.

## CSV rules

- Each row defines a split.
- Columns optionally specify the split ID, name, capped/uncapped status, allocation, active status, feature, or user test group allocation. Optionally, columns can also associate creatives, bids, or expected values with a split. The columns are in an AND relationship. That is, a split matches the criteria specified by all the columns.
- Separate multiple values with commas.
- You can modify any feature to exclude a value with the operator "not". This matches impressions where one or more of the specified values is not true.

Segment operators work slightly differently from other operators:

- Separate multiple segments with commas
- "include" or "exclude" must be specified for all segments
- "ANY" or "ALL" must be specified for segments within a group (even if the group only contains one segment)
  - "ALL" represents AND (it matches impressions when all of the specified values are true)
  - "ANY" represents OR (it matches impressions where one or more of the specified values is true)

## Split settings

The following tables describe the allowed values for each column under various feature classes. All columns are optional.

### Basic information

| Column Title | Description |
|---|---|
| ID | The split ID. If specified, the row will replace the existing split definition. If left blank, a new split will be created and an ID will be assigned automatically. |
| Name | The name of the split. |
| Active | The status of the split. "1" is active and "0" is inactive. If left blank, the split will default to active. |

### Behaviors

| Column Title | Description |
|---|---|
| Spend Allocation | The percentage of the line item budget allocated to the split. The spend allocation for each split should be between 1 and 99. If the sum of all specified splits does not equal 100, the remainder will be assigned to impressions that pass ALI targeting but don't meet any split conditions. |
| Priority | This feature is not yet available through CSV import. |
| Cap | Acceptable values are "constrained" (capped) or "unconstrained" (uncapped). If you don't specify, the split will default to uncapped. |
| Max Bid | How much you are willing to pay for impressions, in the local currency set at the Advertiser level |
| Bid Multiplier | This feature is not yet available through CSV import. |
| Creatives | List the IDs of creatives you would like to serve on this split. <br> **Example:** <br> `98603894, 98714312, 98754614` |
| Custom Macros | This feature is not yet available through CSV import. |
| Test Groups | Activates the user test groups feature, targeting a unique group of users per split for A/B testing. The value represents the percentage of eligible users on the line item to be targeted. <br> **Example:** <br> Target 20% of eligible users: <br> `20` <br> :::image type="content" source="media/splits-test-groups.png" alt-text="Spreadsheet specifying User Test Group allocations and features for all the splits on a line item."::: |
