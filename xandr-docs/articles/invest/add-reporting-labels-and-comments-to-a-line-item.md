# Microsoft Invest - Add Reporting Labels and comments to a line item

You can optionally assign custom reporting labels (Trafficker, Sales Rep, and Line Item Type) to a line item so that you can create reports tracking metrics across multiple line items, as well as add comments to a line item for your reference. Comments will not appear in reporting.

It will take new labels about 30 minutes to appear in reporting.

1. Go to the **Reporting Labels** section of the line item.
1. Enter a trafficker, sales rep, or line item type.
