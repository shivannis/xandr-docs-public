# Microsoft Invest - Member analytics report

This report lets you view both buy and sell-side data for your Member. For more granular analytics on a specific advertiser or publisher, use the **Advertiser Analytics** and **Publisher Analytics** reports.

**Time frame**

All dates and times are given in UTC.

**Time ranges**

Time ranges define the time period of the data extracted for the report. The following is a complete list of time ranges available for reports.

However, all time ranges are not available for every report.

**Intervals**

Intervals determine how your data is grouped together into rows in the report response. The following is a complete list of intervals available for reports. However, all intervals are not available for every report.

- Hourly: Data is grouped into rows by the hour.
- Daily: Data is grouped into rows by the day.
- Monthly: Data is grouped into rows by the month.
- Cumulative: Data is grouped together in one figure, covering the entire selected time range.

**Data retention period**

Most data in this report is maintained permanently (exceptions noted below). After:

- 100 days, you are no longer able to report on hourly data (however, daily, monthly and cumulative intervals are still available)
- 14 months, you are no longer able to report on individual:
  - Creatives
  - Placements
  - Brands

In some cases Analytics reports can show delivery that does not match [Dates and Times in Reporting](./dates-and-times-in-reporting.md) for a given advertiser or publisher. This is due to the way that Analytics reporting data older than 100 days and 14 months is aggregated. The data from Billing reports are kept in non-aggregated form indefinitely.

**Real time data**

Real Time Data is a new feature being offered within this report (not all users have access yet). Traditionally, reports have had a 2 hour built-in delay to allow for a fuller reconciliation with conversions, impressions and other metrics associated with transactions. However, in some cases, it is important to have up-to-the-minute information even if it has not been fully reconciled yet. Dimensions which support the real-time option are marked with the clock icon.

:::image type="content" source="./media/real-time-data-reporting.png" alt-text="Screenshot of real time data reporting":::

- To use this new feature, set the **Real Time Data** field to **Included**. This will cause the data in your report to contain both real-time and the more fully reconciled batch file data. If you want the report to break out the real-time data from batch file data, select the **Real-Time status** checkbox.
- Do not use information in the real-time data portion of your report to bill your clients as that data may change slightly once fully reconciled within 2 to 4 hours. For more information about how quickly reporting data is processed, see [Availability of Reporting Data](./availability-of-reporting-data.md).

**Time ranges including dates occurring greater than 45 days ago**: If you create a Member analytics report with the **Range** field set to "Lifetime", "Quarter to Date" or "Custom" (where the end date is greater than 45 days from today), your report (regardless of metrics included) will be added to a special queue for "resource-intensive" reports. As a result, the report may take longer than usual to complete. In addition, these resource-intensive reports may, due to the amount of data being requested, fail before being completed. If your report fails to complete, you will receive a notification. If your report request fails, you can:

- rerun the report at a later time.
- use a report type other than Member Analytics.
- alter the way you structure your reports (if possible) so they do not include dates greater than 45 days ago.

If you are frequently requesting Member analytics reports which include dates longer than 45 day ago, you may need to consider running these reports via the API, caching the data and using [Bulk Reporting Feeds](../digital-platform-api/bulk-reporting-feeds.md) or [Log-Level Data Feeds](../log-level-data/log-level-data-feeds.md) (LLD).

**Currency 2.0**

> [!NOTE]
> By enabling **Currency 2.0**, you can select a currency for each individual report if you prefer not to use **USD** as the default currency. The report will show all the monetary fields in your report using the selected currency. For example, if you select **Advertiser**, click the **Currency 2.0** toggle to enable it, and select **Japanese Yen (JPY)** from the **Currency** menu, the report will show all monetary data in JPY, including data associated with child objects such as line items.

## Dimensions

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - The **Filter?** column shows whether a dimension can be used as a filter as well as being used to group by.

## To run your report

Follow these steps to run your report.

1. Select **Reporting** from the appropriate top menu (depending on how your account has been configured).
    1. Or, from the Publishers top menu, click on **Prebid Server Premium** > **Analytics** > **Prebid Server Analytics**
1. Select the relevant report from the list. The **Report** screen shows the available filters, dimensions, and delivery options for the report. The selections you make here will determine what report data is delivered to you, and how.
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > For an explanation of how grouping and filtering work, see [Dimensions, Metrics, Filtering, and Grouping](./dimensions-metrics-filtering-and-grouping.md).

1. Select the relevant filters to limit the data displayed to just the information you want. For example, rather than running a report that shows impressions for all inventory sources, you may want to list results for just a select few. When you select a filter (by clicking **Edit**), a selection panel appears. Select items in the **Available** list (left), then click **Add** to include them in the **Chosen** list (right).
1. Group by Dimension. Grouping allows you to display rows of data in the order you prefer.
    > [!WARNING]
    > The more dimensions you group by, the larger the data set that is returned. Larger data sets can take substantially longer to process. Be sure to group using only the dimensions you need.

1. Choose a delivery option. Once you've selected your filters and grouped by your chosen dimensions, you need to choose a delivery method. Available delivery methods include:

    - **Run now, show results in screen**: For smaller amounts of data, you may want to view the report as soon as possible in your browser. You can download the report in XLSX, CSV, Excel/TSV and JSON format. However, there is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when downloading as XLSX and Excel file.
