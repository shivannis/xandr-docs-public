# Microsoft Invest - In-Market audiences

Microsoft In-market Audiences are curated lists of users determined to be in market and ready to buy within a particular category. These segments are based on Microsoft’s unique intent signals, including search on Bing and user activity on Microsoft solutions. The power of search behaviour indicates that the audiences have a high probability of conversion.

In-market Audiences are global, and available in more than 90 markets. Take a look at this [up-to-date list](https://download.microsoft.com/download/4/0/0/40099106-6f9f-4b38-8aac-0dc7567404db/In-Market-Audiences-segment-list-Invest.xlsx) for all the available in-market audience segments.
