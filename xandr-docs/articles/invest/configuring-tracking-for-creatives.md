# Configuring Tracking for Creatives in Microsoft Invest

When adding creatives, you can set a variety of tracking parameters from
the **Pixels (optional)** section,
such as frequency and recency caps, third-party tracking pixels, and
segment pixels.

- **[Click Tracking](click-tracking.md)**: The system automatically runs a click tracking test
  when the creative is uploaded. If the system fails to automatically
  run a click tracking test for your creative when using the single
  creative workflow to upload one creative, you can manually click the
  **Run Test** button from the
  **Pixels (optional)** section.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If the click tracking test is unsuccessful, which is   indicated by a red **X**, re-upload the file or update the landing page URL and click the **try again** link that displays in the **Pixels (optional)** section.

- **[Frequency and Recency Caps](frequency-and-recency-caps.md)**: You can specify the number of times and pace in which a creative can be shown to a given user. For more information, see
  [Frequency and Recency Caps](frequency-and-recency-caps.md).
- **[Third-Party Tracking Pixels for Creatives](third-party-tracking-pixels-for-creatives.md)**: You can create third-party
  tracking pixels at either the advertiser or
  Member level and then associate them with your
  creatives.
  You can also associate custom third-party tracking pixels with your creatives if you want to use another system to track impressions by selecting the **Format (Image URL, HTML URL, JavaScript URL, or Raw JavaScript)** for the pixel and entering URLs (**Secure** and **Non-Secure**) for each tracking event.The following tracking events are supported:

| Tracking Event | Creative Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
