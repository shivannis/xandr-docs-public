# Microsoft Invest - Manage partner fees

You must have [network level access](getting-started-with-roles.md) to perform this task.

The Partner Fees page allows you to create, view, modify, and delete fees. You can see which advertisers a fee is eligible for and which line items it has been applied to.

## View fee details

1. Go to the **Fees** screen (hover over your member name in the upper-right corner of the menu bar and click **Fees**). The **Fees** table lists basic fee information, including vendor, type, value, calculation method, which advertisers the fee is eligible for, and whether the fee is required for all the advertiser's line items.
1. For additional details, click on the fee. The **Fee Details** pane includes a longer fee description, supply type, the line items associated with the fee and their status (upcoming, in progress, or completed), and the history of the fee's creation and updates.

## Modify a fee

On the **Partner Fee** page or the **Partner Fee** details pane, click **Edit** (the pencil icon). You can modify:

- Fee vendors
- [Fee Type](fee-type.md)
- How a fee is [calculated](fee-calculations.md)
- Whether a fee is required for all of an advertiser's line items
- The advertisers for which a fee is eligible

For more information, see [Create a Partner Fee](create-a-partner-fee.md).

## Delete a fee

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot delete a partner fee that is associated with a line item.

1. Go to the **Fees** screen (hover over your member name in the upper-right corner of the menu bar and click **Fees**).
1. Select the partner fee, then select **Actions** > **Delete**.
