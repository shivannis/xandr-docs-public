# Microsoft Invest - Understanding bid rejections

There are many reasons a bid might be rejected. Rejected bids show up on the **Deals** screen in the **Ineligible Bids** column and are shown in greater detail in the **Rejections** section of the **Deal Details** screen. The **Bid Rejections** table lists out error IDs you might encounter when a bid is rejected, the cause of the errors, and what actions buyers and/or sellers should take to resolve these errors.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **About Impbus Error IDs, Error Messages, and Bid Rejection Reasons**
>
> Each bid rejection reason has a distinct error ID or set of error IDs connected to it. The **Impbus Error ID** shows up as a validation in the Impbus API and in the API and UI Bid Error Report. The **Error Message** shows up in the Bid Error Reports as well as in the **Rejections** section of the **Deal Details** screen.
