# Microsoft Invest - Add Premium Video Catalog deals to deal lists

Using the Inventory Library, buyers can add premium video catalog (PVC) deals to new and existing deal lists for all line item types except programmatic guaranteed buying line items.

1. Use the available filters to search through the various PVC deals:
    - **Deal Updates**: Shows deals that have been recently updated or added to the premium video inventory.
    - **Parent Publisher**: Includes a list of companies or channel partners that have direct access to the premium video inventory.
    - **Channel Publisher**: Includes a list of companies and networks affiliated with the parent publisher.
