# Incoming bid response from bidders

> [!WARNING]
> This describes the integration of the [OpenRTB 2.4 protocol](https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OpenRTB-API-Specification-Version-2-4-FINAL.pdf).

A bidder will send a bid response after it receives a [Bid Request](./outgoing-bid-request-to-bidders.md) from the impression bus. The bid response will include the bidder's bid (`price`) and chosen creative (`creative_id` or `creative_code`). This creative will be served if the bid is ultimately accepted by the ad server. Multiple bids within the bid response are encouraged.

## Implementation

Refer to the following links to locate the objects that you need more information on.

[Bid request object](#bid-response-object) | [Seat Bid Object](#seat-bid-object) | [Bid Object](#bid-object) | [Bid Response Extension Object](#bid-response-extension-object) | [AppNexus Object](#appnexus-object) | [Custom Macro Object](#custom-macro-object) | [Bid Payment Type Object](#bid-payment-type-object) |

Xandr expects all calls to return HTTP code 200 except for an empty bid response (no bid), which will return HTTP code 204. We currently support the following fields in the bid response object.

### Bid response object

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `id` | string | **Required**: The ID of the bid request to which this is a response. |
| `seatbid` | array of objects | **Required if a bid is made**: Used for identifying seatbid objects. See [Seat Bid Object](#seat-bid-object) for more information. |
|`bidid` | string | The bid response ID to assist tracking for bidders. This value is chosen by the bidder for cross-reference.<br><br> **Note**: This is used only to populate the macro `${AUCTION_BID_ID}`. We do not store this information. |
| `cur` | string | The bid currency using ISO-4217 alphabetic codes. If omitted, default is USD. Also used for the macro `${AUCTION_CURRENCY}` in the win notify URL and creative or pixel payload. |

### Seat bid object

Xandr supports the following fields in the `seatbid` object, each of which represents a different bidder seat and contains one or more individual bids.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `bid` | array of objects | **Required**: An array of bid objects; each bid object relates to an Impression Object in the [Bid Request](./outgoing-bid-request-to-bidders.md).<br><br>**Note**: If supported by an exchange, one Impression Object can have many bid objects. See [Bid Object](#bid-object) for more information. |
| `seat` | string | **Required**: The ID of the member whose creative is chosen by the bidder and corresponds to the Xandr `member_id`. Also used to populate the `${AUCTION_SEAT_ID}` macro in the win notify URL and creative or pixel payload.<br><br>**Note**: <br> - For DSPs migrated to Buyer Seat ID bidding, they can use buyer IDs native to their own systems. These identifiers will be registered as Seat Codes in Xandr systems.<br> - This feature is currently in Closed Beta. If you are interested in participating, please reach out to your Xandr representative. |

### Bid object

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `id` | string | **Required**: The ID for the bid object; this is chosen by the bidder for tracking and debugging purposes. Useful when multiple bids are submitted for a single impression for a given seat. |
| `impid` | string | **Required**: The ID of the impression object to which this bid applies. Should match the `id` field from the bid request's impression object. Can be used to populate the `${AUCTION_IMP_ID}` macro. |
| `price` | float | **Required**: The bid price expressed in CPM. Also used to populate the `${AUCTION_PRICE}` macro.<br><br>If the `bid_payment_type` is not set to `"Impression"`, then price will be the eCPM price for the bid, and the `payment_type_price` will be used to populate the `${{AUCTION_PRICE} macro.PRICE}` macro.<br><br>**Note**: `bid_payment_type` is not enabled for all clients. Please reach out to your account representative for this feature.<br><br>**Warning**: Although this value is a float, OpenRTB strongly suggests using integer math for accounting to avoid rounding errors. |
| `adid` | string | The Xandr creative ID, viewable via the API using the [Creative Service](./creative-service.md). This ID references the actual ad to be served if the bid wins. Can be used to populate the $`{AUCTION_AD_ID}` macro. If both `adid` and `crid` are passed, `adid` takes precedence. |
| `nurl` | string | The win notify URL, which is dropped as a pixel into the web browser or SDK. Our server pings this URL when it receives a client-side notification from the device, which indicates that we won the auction. Responses will be sent server side. This occurs at the same time when we record the impression. The max length is 2000 characters with macros expanded.<br><br>The following macros are supported in the notify URL:<br>`${AUCTION_ID}` - Xandr `auction_id_64`<br>`${AUCTION_BID_ID}` - ID of the bid specified in the `bidid` field in the bid response<br>`${AUCTION_IMP_ID}` - ID of the impression, from the `impid` field in the bid object of the `seatbid` object<br>`${AUCTION_SEAT_ID}` - ID of the winning seat, from the `seat` field in the `seatbid` object<br>`${AUCTION_AD_ID}` - ID of the buyer's creative, from the `adid` field in the `bid` object of the `seatbid` object<br>`${AUCTION_PRICE}` - Clearing price of the impression in the currency specified in the `cur` field in the bid response<br>`${AUCTION_CURRENCY}` - Currency of the clearing price, as specified in the `cur` field in the bid response<br>`${CREATIVE_CODE}` - The `code` field set on the `creative` object via the API when registering a creative<br>`${AN_PAYMENT_TYPE}` - ID of the payment type of bid specified in the `bid_payment_type` field of the bid response<br><br>**Note**: <br> - This macro is not enabled for all clients. Please reach out to your account representative for this feature.<br> - Only the macros in the preceding list can be used in the notify URL, no other macros are supported in the bid response. |
| `lurl` | string | **Warning**: This feature is currently in closed beta testing and is not available to all bidder integrations. If you would like to use this field in the bid response, please reach out to your account representative or file a support ticket at [https://help.xandr.com](https://help.xandr.com/s/login/).<br><br>Loss notice URL called by Xandr when a bid is known to have been lost. Substitution macros may be included. Responses will be sent server side.<br><br>The following macros are supported in the loss notice URL.<br>`${AUCTION_ID}` - Xandr `auction_id_64`<br>`${AUCTION_BID_ID}` - ID of the bid specified in the `bidid` field in the bid response<br>`${AUCTION_IMP_ID}` - ID of the impression, from the `impid` field in the `bid` object of the `seatbid` object<br>`${AUCTION_SEAT_ID}` - ID of the winning seat, from the `seat` field in the `seatbid` object<br>`${AUCTION_AD_ID}` - ID of the buyer's creative, from the `adid` field in the `bid` object of the `seatbid` object<br>`${AUCTION_LOSS}` - Loss reason codes<br>`${AUCTION_CURRENCY}` - Currency of the clearing price, as specified in the `cu`r field in the bid response<br>`${CREATIVE_CODE}` - The `code` field set on the `creative` object via the API when registering a creative.<br><br>For the full list of loss reason codes that are supported in the `${AUCTION_LOSS}` macro, see [Loss Reason Codes](./loss-reason-codes.md). |
| `crid` | string | The creative ID from the bidder's system. Used to reference a Xander creative based on the creative code as set via the [Creative Service](./creative-service.md). If both `adid` and `crid` are passed, `adid` takes precedence. |
| `cid` | string | The campaign ID from the bidder's system. Used for SSP reporting. |
| `dealid` | string | The deal ID from the `deal` object in the [Bid Request](./outgoing-bid-request-to-bidders.md), if this bid relates to a deal. |
| `ext` | object | Used for identifying platform-specific extensions to the OpenRTB bid response. See [Bid Response Extension Object](#bid-response-extension-object). |

The string is entered as freeform text and will be automatically URL- and/or cookie-encoded by ImpBus. |
| `click_url` | string | The click URL to be associated with the creative. This field should contain a redirect link. For example, [https://mydomain.com/abcd?redir=](https://mydomain.com/abcd?redir=) |
| `enable_bid_shading` | integer | **Note**: This field is in the process of being deprecated. It is set as **false** irrespective of the value sent in the bid response. |
| `bid_payment_type` | array of objects | **Note**: This feature is not enabled by default. You must request to have this field enabled.<br><br>Specifies the payment type for which the Bidder is bidding and will be billed. If omitted, then we will consider the payment type to be `'impression'`. |

> [!NOTE]
> **Why we don't support the `adm` field?**
>
> Xandr works with members who care deeply about brand and reputation. For this reason, we are careful to ensure that the advertisements (creatives) that pass through our system are acceptable to all parties. For quality assurance, all creatives that serve on third-party inventory must be pre-registered using the [Creative Service](./creative-service.md).
>
> For these reasons, Xandr does not support the `adm` field (which allows bidders to pass in the actual ad markup). Instead, we construct the ad markup using the provided `adid` and `nurl` for win notification.

## Win notification

For more information, see the definition of the `nurl` field above.

> [!NOTE]
> In certain auction types, a lost or pending notification may be generated prior to the win notification. Win notifications are always authoritative and override any other notifications previously received for that auction.

**Loss notification**

If you opt for a loss notification, it will look something like this. The loss notification information appears at the end of the response.
