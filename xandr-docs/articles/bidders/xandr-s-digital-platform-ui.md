# Xandr's digital platform UI

Some advertisers may not have their own real-time optimization engine or may not desire to build a bidder from scratch. These advertisers can use Xandr's Digital Platform UI (formerly known as AppNexus Console) to buy inventory on the Xandr platform. The Digital Platform UI is an independent bidder and optimization engine, with a web-based as well as an API-based interface, operationally maintained by Xandr. If you are interested in the Digital Platform UI, please contact your Xandr representative.
