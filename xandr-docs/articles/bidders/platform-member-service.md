# Bidders - Platform member service

Public information about members is available to other members on the platform through the Platform Member service.

Any entity that has a financial relationship with the Xandr platform (usually a buyer or seller) needs to be added to the Xandr system as a "member" before they can conduct transactions. Members can be registered with the [Member Service](member-service.md) either by a bidder or by Xandr personnel.
