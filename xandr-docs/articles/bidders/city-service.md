# Bidders - City service

The read-only City Service allows you to see information about the
cities registered in the Xandr system, including
the region, designated market area, and country to which each city
belongs. You can use this service to retrieve the IDs of cities for
targeting in campaigns (see `city_targets` in the [Enhanced Bidder Profiles](enhanced-bidder-profiles.md)).
