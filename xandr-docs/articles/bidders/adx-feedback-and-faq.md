# AdX guidelines and restrictions

We strictly adhere to the guidelines and restrictions of the Google Ad Manager platform, all of which can be found at the links below.

- File size is too large (initial load size is bigger than 50K).

  From: [Image ad requirements](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/176108?hl=en)

- Animation continues after 30 seconds: "Animated ads are restricted to a maximum of 30 seconds (at a 15-20 fps frame rate), after which point they must remain static."

  From: [Requirements for third-party ad serving](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/94230?hl=en)

- Creative is from or makes a call to an unapproved adserver.

  The list of approved adservers is here: [Ad Manager Certified External Vendors](https://developers.google.com/third-party-ads/adx-vendors)

- Content is banned (weapons, pharmaceuticals, etc.)

  All AdX content restrictions can be found here: [Google Ads policies](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6008942?hl=en)

  This message will also be given for flashing and strobing creatives: "Strobing, flashing backgrounds, or otherwise distracting ads are not allowed."

- Contains auto-video, auto-audio, or is expandable

  "Ad animation must be confined to the allotted ad space. Ads that expand beyond the frame or otherwise encroach on the website are not allowed."

  From: [Requirements for third-party ad serving](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/94230?hl=en)

  "The audio portion of your video ad will be played when a user clicks on your ad" and "The video portion of your video ad will be played when a user clicks the image, URL, or the play button. The video will not automatically replay; the user must click the play button to initiate a replay."
