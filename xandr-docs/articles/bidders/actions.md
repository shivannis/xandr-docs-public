# Actions

Actions is where you can activate, deactivate, delete, or resubmit a creative. You can also view the basic attributes that describe the creative.

Select a creative by selecting the **checkbox** to the left of the creative row.

Click **Actions**. The following selections will be made available:

- **Activate/Deactivate** – You can activate or deactivate a creative.
- **Resubmit for Audit** – This will only be available if the creative you checked was rejected for audit. If you felt a creative was rejected incorrectly, you can resubmit it.
- **Delete** – You can delete a creative.

> [!NOTE]
> The creative can be viewed in more detail by clicking on the **magnifying glass** icon next to each number in the **ID** column. Clicking on this will access the **Creative Preview**, where you can preview the creative. You have the choice of previewing it there, or click the **Open in new tab** option.
