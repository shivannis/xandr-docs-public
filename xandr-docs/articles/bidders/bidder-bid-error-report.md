# Bidder Bid Error report

The **Bidder Bid Error Report** allows bidders to see the volume and types of bid errors that their bidders are generating when they bid.

> [!NOTE]
> The errors listed in the Bidder Bid Error Report are considered **pre-auction** errors, meaning these are bids reject prior to the start of the auction for a specific impression.

This is meant to be a helpful troubleshooting tool. Here are a few suggestions:

- Group your results by the **actual error**, to see what your most common errors are.
- If you are troubleshooting a specific area, add dimensions like **Seller Member**, **Ad Profile**, or **Creative** to understand exactly which options and which creatives are generating that error.
- Group the results by **Deal** – to troubleshoot errors for a specific deal.
