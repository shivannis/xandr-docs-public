# Bidders - Ad profile service

A member who owns inventory may want to create "ad approval profiles" to define what kinds of ads can and cannot run on their pages for quality control purposes. The Ad Profile Service lets you create your ad approval profiles. Once an ad profile has been created, it can either be associated to individual TinyTags through the [TinyTag Service](tinytag-service.md) or broadly set at the member level through the [Member Service](member-service.md).

Approval profiles consist of three elements: members, brands, and creatives. When creating an ad profile, you can approve or ban each creative in the system individually, but you may prefer to save time by approving or banning entire brands or members.

- A member should be trusted if you believe their ads will **always** be acceptable. For instance, you may "trust" Specific Media to run quality ads, so you can mitigate the need to audit each of their creatives.
- A brand should be trusted if you believe that ads of this brand will **almost always** be acceptable. However, you will always have the ability to ban a specific creative even if it is part of a "trusted" brand. If the specific creative is not banned, it will run by default.
- A brand should be banned if you believe that ads of this brand will **never** be acceptable. You will **not** have the ability to approve a specific creative assigned by a "banned" brand.
- The default profile (blank or ID set to 0) will ban unaudited ads from other members (i.e. where the `member_id` of the creative is different than the `member_id` of the TinyTag).

## Example

### To create a new ad profile, create a text file in JSON format

Below we have used the "cat" command to output an example ad profile JSON file.

```
$ cat ad_profile
{
   "ad_profile":{
      "member_id":25,
      "brands":[
         {
            "id":23,
            "status":"trusted"
         },
         {
            "id":120,
            "status":"banned"
         },
         {
            "id":123,
            "status":"banned"
         }
      ],
      "creatives":[
         {
            "id":4,
            "approved":true
         },
         {
            "id":12,
            "approved":true
         },
         {
            "id":123,
            "approved":false
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

### Add this ad profile to your member (25) with a POST request

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -d @ad_profile  "https://api.adnxs.com/ad-profile/25"
{
    "response": {
        "status": "OK",
        "id": "50"
    }
}
```

### The ID of the ad profile is 50. You can view it with a GET request.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies "https://api.adnxs.com/ad-profile/25/50"
{
   "response":{
      "ad_profile":[
         {
            "id":50,
            "member_id":25,
            "brands":[
               {
                  "id":"23",
                  "status":"trusted"
               },
               {
                  "id":"120",
                  "status":"banned"
               },
               {
                  "id":"123",
                  "status":"banned"
               }
            ],
            "creatives":[
               {
                  "id":"4",
                  "approved":"true"
               },
               {
                  "id":"12",
                  "approved":"true"
               },
               {
                  "id":"123",
                  "approved":"false"
               }
            ],
            "active":true,
            "last_activity":"2009-01-03 05:29:57"
         }
      ],
      "status":"OK"
   }
}
```
