# Overview - Creative standards and auditing

Avoiding channel conflict is a major challenge for publishers working
with a third party to sell their inventory. Every publisher has a unique
sales pitch to top brand advertisers. Xandr
understands the value of these advertiser relationships and how crucial
these relationships are to a publisher's business. Any chance in
jeopardizing business with top advertisers is not a risk worth taking.
Xandr was built with publisher protection in
mind, not as an afterthought. Xandr has brand
and creative controls built in to address channel conflict.

Xandr enables publisher inventory to be
auctioned on a per impression basis to premium brands.
Xandr UI allows brand and creative management to
manually control brand exclusions on specific publisher's properties.
