# Click request

The impression bus will insert our clicktracking URL into the creative
at serve time and log and report any clicks that occur. If the member
whose creative served is integrated with a bidder, the Impression Bus
also passes along the click information to the bidder's designated click
handler (defined using the `click_uri` field of the [Bidder Service](bidder-service.md)).
