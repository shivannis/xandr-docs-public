# Enhanced Bidder profiles

Bidder profiles filter traffic and allow bidders to apply business rules on objects. This is to ensure specific types of traffic are either received or not received. Xandr will partner with you, and provide the proper tools to ensure you have a profile that
matches your business needs.

## High-level changes

For an list of changes from legacy to the current enhanced bidder profiles, please visit the [changelog](changelog-for-enhanced-bidder-profiles.md).

- An impression only needs to meet the requirement of one of the profiles in order to pass.
  - There is no longer a parent/child hierarchy
  - For more information about the change in hierarchy, please see here: [Hierarchy and Ad Type Targeting for Enhanced Bidder Profiles](hierarchy-and-ad-type-targeting-for-enhanced-bidder-profiles.md).
- Ad type filtering and targeting have been added.
  - You will now be able to block/target native, banner, video, audio
  - For more information about ad type targeting, please see here: [Hierarchy and Ad Type Targeting for Enhanced Bidder
    Profiles](hierarchy-and-ad-type-targeting-for-enhanced-bidder-profiles.md)
- Removal of passthrough percent.
  - You can now set QPS caps per DC. 
  - For more information on how to set a QPS cap, please see here: [Bidder Instance Service](bidder-instance-service.md)
- Addition of Exchange targeting
  - We have grouped our inventory in easy-to-understand groups
