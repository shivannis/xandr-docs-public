# Incoming bid request from SSPs

> [!NOTE]
> This describes Xandr's integration with the [OpenRTB 2.4 protocol](https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OpenRTB-API-Specification-Version-2-4-FINAL.pdf).
>
> This Bid Request is sent by SSPs and contains information on which advertisers and creatives are allowed to win an auction. Xandr will produce a [Bid Response](./outgoing-bid-response-to-ssps.md) that contains a bid price and a creative to serve.

## Implementation

### Endpoints

You will receive one or more endpoints that you can use to `POST` bid requests. Contact your Xandr representative to receive your endpoints. Endpoints will generally look like the following:

```
https://seller-region.adnxs.com/openrtb2?member_id=YOUR_MEMBER_ID
```

- `member_id` is required; this is your member ID on the Xandr platform. This ID will be provided by Xandr during integration.
- You will receive one endpoint for each region in which you operate. Possible regions include: `us-east`, `us-west`, `emea`, and `apac`.

Any other query string value will be ignored.

### Bid request object

> [!NOTE]
> The `tmax` field is not supported. Speak with your Integrations Consultant to configure auction timeout limits. **Multi-format impressions** are not supported. The format's precedence if we receive multi-format impression is as following:
>
> - video
> - audio
> - banner
> - native
