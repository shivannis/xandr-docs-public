# Getting started

Xandr is happy to have you on board as a Supply Partner. Here are several resources to help you get started:

- [How Integration Works](./how-integration-works.md) <br> This easy-to-follow diagram walks you through the process that occurs when a supply partner that has integrated with Xandr receives an ad call.  
- [Integration Process](./integration-process.md) <br> If you want to review, plan, and execute a new OpenRTB integration, or migrate from a custom SSP protocol integration to the OpenRTB standard, take a look at this walk-through. Here you'll find a list of prerequisites and step-by-step instructions. 
- [FAQ - Integration Process](./faq-integration-process.md) <br> A list of questions and answers to help guide you through your OpenRTB integration.
- [Best Practices](./best-practices.md) <br> As a Supply Partner, you should review this list of Best Practices to ensure that you remain in good standing and continue to have access to Xandr's exchange.
