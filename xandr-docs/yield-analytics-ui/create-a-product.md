# Create a product

Use the following steps to create a product:

1. Click the down arrow next to the **Products** tab.
1. Click **Create a Product** from the drop-down menu. The **Create Product** screen is accessed.
1. Enter the **Product Name**. This is the name that you decide to give the product. It is a required field.
1. Enter the **Product External Id**. This is a identifier that you may want to include to track the product on your system.
1. Enter the **Target Expression**. This is accomplished by clicking the **Builder** tab.
1. Once the target expression is created, it will be displayed on the **Create Product** screen.

> [!TIP]
> After the target expression is created, it creates an actual link that you can click on from the Create Product screen. Clicking that link will access a read-only screen.

## Product type selection

While choosing the **Product Type**, here are two options with radio buttons that identify which type of product you are creating:

- Rate Card –  Product that is sold frequently by the sales team and represents the product catalog (e.g., ROS 728x90).
- Reporting – Product that is used for reporting purposes, but is not generally not sold (e.g., Top three ad sizes in the Sports section).

Specify the Default **Rate Card CPM**. This is the default **Rate Card CPM** that is binded to this product.

## Product groups

You can associate any product to product groups. In the **Associated Product Groups** section, click the **Add to Product Groups** button. This accesses the **Product Group** screen.

1. There is a filter that assists searching for a specific product group(s). You can filter by the following parameters: **Contains**, **Starts with**, **Ends with**, **Equals**.

To add a new product group from this screen, click the Add new button. This accesses the **Add New Product Group** screen.
