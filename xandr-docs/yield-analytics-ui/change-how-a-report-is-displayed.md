# Change how a report is displayed

You have several options to change how reports are displayed:

- To change the report's display type (e.g., from a bar chart to a table) click the corresponding button.
- To change how many instances of the dimension are shown per page, select the number from the Display drop-down menu on the top right.

In addition, for reports that have Product, Order, and Order line as the dimension, you can click a line or bar to view more details about it. To see additional detail, click **View** and select an option to see more details about that specific data set.
