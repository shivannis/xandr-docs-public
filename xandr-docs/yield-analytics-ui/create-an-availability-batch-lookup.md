# Create an availability batch lookup

You can run multiple availability lookups as part of a single availability report, by creating a batch lookup.

1. Set up a new lookup for availability based on a combination of targeting attributes or open an existing saved lookup. Then click **Add to Batch**. The Availability Report panel displays the available inventory based on your lookup criteria, excluding CPM, impressions, and capacity.
1. Modify the lookup criteria to set up a different set of targeting, and click **Add to Batch**. The Availability Report panel is updated with the available inventory based on your original lookup criteria and the new lookup criteria.
1. Repeat step 2 as needed. Then click **Run Batch**.
1. On the confirmation dialog that appears, note the batch lookup name, and then click **OK**.

> [!TIP]
> The lookup query that you set up on this screen will be broken out into multiple result rows that will appear in the Availability Report panel at the bottom of the screen once you click **Add to Batch**. The maximum number of rows is capped at 10,000 by default. That figure represents a reasonable limit, which is configurable at your request. Please contact your Client Services Manager if you feel that a higher ceiling is necessary.
