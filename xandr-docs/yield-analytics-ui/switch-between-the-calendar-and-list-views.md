# Switch between the calendar and list views

The **View Calendar** page can be displayed in two views:

- A calendar view that shows a graphical high-level overview of each day on the selected month's calendar.
- A list view that shows the month in a table where each row can be expanded to drill down for detailed information for a given day.

To switch from the calendar view (default) to the list view, on the calendar toolbar, click.
