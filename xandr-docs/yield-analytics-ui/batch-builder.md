# Batch builder

The **Batch Builder** allows you to collect multiple lookups that you can then run as a batch. This is particularly useful if you want to run a large number of lookups, or if you want to save and reuse a set of lookups either on a scheduled or ad hoc basis.

## Saving a batch

- Open a batch that is already saved. Make any desired changes to it.
- When you are finished, click **Save**.
- Clicking this accesses the **Save Batch** screen. This screen has these fields:
  - Save as New (radio button)
  - Replace Existing (radio button)
  - Name (text box)
  - Category (pull-down menu)
  - Description (text box)
  - Permissions (table)

- After making selections, click **Save** to save this batch. Now when you click the **Open** button, you will see this batch.

## Opening/sending a batch

- Click **Open**. Your saved batches are displayed.
- Click **Send**. This accesses the **Send a Lookup Report** screen. This screen has these fields:
  - Recurrence (drop-down menu)
  - One-Time (radio button)
    - Immediately
    - Date
  - Send To (text box)
  - Message (text box)
  - Attachment (drop down menu)
- Make your selections to schedule and send your batch.

## Running a batch

- Clicking **Run** accesses the **Batch Queue**.
- It clears the batch off the **Batch Builder** screen. It now appears in superscript on the **Batch Queue** tab. (1 item)
- The batch runs in a queue in the background. You can continue to do other work.

> [!TIP]
> You can run up to 10,000 lookups (default). If you need the ability to run more, please contact your client services representative.
