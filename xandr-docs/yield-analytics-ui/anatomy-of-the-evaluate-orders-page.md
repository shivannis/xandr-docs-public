# Anatomy of the evaluate orders page

The Evaluate Orders page has two tabs where you can review proposed orders:

- The **Order Analytics** tab displays some key metrics by which you can compare the proposal to the rest of the clients or advertisers for your agency.  It also displays the potential contracted revenue by price and contract type.
- The **Order Lines** tab displays the availability of all order lines in the proposal. It also displays any similar alternate products.

## Anatomy of the evaluate orders order analytics tab interface

The **Order Analytics** tab on the **Evaluate Orders** page is comprised of the following sections:

- **Order details panel** – Displays the order's details.
- **Key Metrics panel** – Displays bar charts that you can use to compare the order to all other orders in the system.
- **Order Composition panel** – Displays how the order's placements will be consumed (CPM vs. CPD and standard vs. sponsorship).

The **Order Lines** tab is comprised of the following sections:

- **Filter panel** – Used to find a specific order line.
- **Order Line Listing panel** – Displays a list of all order lines in the proposal.
- **Product Details panel** – Displays details for the selected order line in three tabs: Availability, Price, and Alternate Products.

## Using alternative products to solve pricing/availability issues

Alternative products are available in Evaluate Orders to help resolve! Price and Avails flags!

### About alternate products

The Score for an alternate product indicates how closely it's related to the order line's product, based on the following criteria:

- Alternate sizes – Products with the same targeting as the order line's product, but with a different value for Size.
- Audience affinity – Products that heavily overlap the same set of other products.
- Purchase behavior – Products that frequently appear together on the same orders.

### View alternate products

In the **Product Details** panel, click the **Alternate Products** tab.

### Add an alternate product to a proposal

1. Click the **Add** button to the left of the product's name. A new order line with the selected product is created at the top of the **Order Line Listing** above the **Product Details**.
1. Enter or change the order line parameters (e.g., Start date, End date, Imps) as needed.
1. Click **Update**.

To remove the order line, click **Edit** and clear the **Included** checkbox.
