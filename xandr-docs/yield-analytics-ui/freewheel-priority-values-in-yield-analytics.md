# Freewheel priority values in Yield Analytics

To appropriately rank competing FreeWheel placements, Yield Analytics maps numerical values to FreeWheel priority values.

## Freewheel summary

Yield Analytics assigns priority values for FreeWheel order lines as follows:

- The highest priority ads are the sponsorship ads that additionally have five levels of prioritization.
- Next in priority are guaranteed ads with set priorities from 20 to 11, with 20 being highest precedence.  
- Next in priority are the typical ads that have no priority setting, but compete based on the CPM value of the placement. The more revenue, the higher the rank.
- The lowest priority are negative values, which indicate lower priority (i.e., non-guaranteed ads, with -10 as the lowest).
