# Anatomy of the find products page

The Find Products page on the **Products** tab shows a searchable list of products across your network.

## About the find products interface

The **Find Products** page consists of two main panels:

- **Product list** – This panel on the left side of the page shows a list of the products across your network with a summary of their performance for a specific time period. The metrics in this panel include impressions capacity, consumed impressions, available impressions, sell-through rate, and CPM based on the product's rate card. By default, the list is filtered to show active rate card products and performance for the current month.

  > [!TIP]
  > - You can click in any product's row to expand it and see high-level product details.
  > - You can click the link in the **Product** column for any product to view the product's full details. You can click in any product's row to display a drop-down list from which you can choose to analyze overlapping products, edit the product's details, or add the product to a scenario.

- **Filter panel** – In this panel on the left side of the page, you can define the time period for the performance metrics in the product list. You can apply filters to narrow the list of products by product group, product type, parent product, overlapping products, when the product was created, and/or product status.

Above the product list is a toolbar. This includes a search bar where you can enter search terms to find specific products, change the number of product rows displayed on a page, and scroll through additional pages. You can also export the product list to an Excel spreadsheet (XLS) or comma-separated values (CSV) file.
