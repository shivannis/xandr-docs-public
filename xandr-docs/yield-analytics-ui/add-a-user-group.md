# Add a user group

If you have administrative permissions, you can add user groups to determine permissions for a set of users.

1. On the **Admin Tools** menu, click **Permissions**. The Permissions page appears. This displays the Groups panel with a table of all existing user groups.
1. Above the list of groups, click **Add Group**. The **Group: New Group** panel appears.
1. In **Group Summary** section, in the **Name** field, type a name to identify the group (e.g., `AdOps`), and optionally, in the **Description** field, type an explanation for the group (i.e., `Permissions for the Ad Operations team`).
1. In the **Users in This Group** section, select the usernames you want to add to the group, or click **Select All** to add all available users. As you select users on the left, they're added to the list of users on the right.
1. In the **Features Available In This Group** section, clear the check boxes for the features this group shouldn't be able to access. Select the check boxes for the features this group should be able to access.

    The features are broken up into the following sets: Capacity, Availability, Products, Orders, Proposals, Pricing, Reports, Scenario, Admin Tools, and Other.  
    All features are selected by default.
1. Click **Save**.
