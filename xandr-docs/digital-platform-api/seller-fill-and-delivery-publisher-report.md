# Digital Platform API - Seller fill and delivery publisher report

The Seller Fill and Delivery Report was designed as a troubleshooting tool to provide sellers granular information regarding all impressions sent to Xandr for auction and to help diagnose delivery issues all the way down to the tag and domain level. Using the new descriptive fields, it is possible to see an approximation of overall fill rate on Xandr using the “Total Ad Responses" and "Total Ad Requests” metrics.

The data contained in this report will help pinpoint issues contributing to untransacted impressions stemming from:

- Improper default/passback tag setup
- Inventory blocklisting related to IP or domain blocking
- Video player errors, etc.

> [!NOTE]
> **For video sellers only**: As a result of video caching by video players, the Xandr data pipeline allows a six-hour window to register a response from a video player after the auction is complete and the creative VAST XML has been sent to the page, before considering a video impression ‘non-responsive’ (Bid Sent No Response). Xandr will update some counts, for video tags only, six hours after the time of the auction. Therefore, to receive the most accurate view of video counts across dimensions, schedule your reports to run **after** the six-hour window for a given hour of data.

## Example

### Create JSON formatted report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` of `"seller_fill_and_delivery_publisher"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the `"format"` in which the data should be returned (`csv`, `excel`, or `html`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md).

```
$ cat seller_fill_and_delivery_publisher

{"report":
    {
        "format": "csv",
        "report_interval": "yesterday",
        "row_per": ["geo_country"],
        "columns":["placement_id","imps_kept","total_ad_responses","total_ad_requests","geo_country"],
        "report_type": "seller_fill_and_delivery_publisher"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the [Report Service](./report-service.md)

`POST` the JSON request to get back a report ID.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X post -d @seller_fill_and_delivery_publisher "https://api.appnexus.com/report"

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"c445bca183a3d338dc1c5b85a3d484f5"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service

Make a `GET` call with the report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=c445bca183a3d338dc1c5b85a3d484f5'

{
    "response": {
        "status": "OK",
        "report": {
            "name": null,
            "created_on": "2014-11-19 22:33:31",
            "json_request": "{\"report\":{\"format\":\"csv\",\"report_interval\":\"yesterday\",\"row_per\":[\"geo_country\"],\"columns\":[\"placement_id\",\"imps_kept\",\"total_ad_responses\",\"total_ad_requests\",\"geo_country\"],\"report_type\":\"seller_fill_and_delivery_publisher\",\"filters\":[{\"seller_member_id\":\"958\"}]}}",
            "url": "report-download?id=c445bca183a3d338dc1c5b85a3d484f5"
        },
        "execution_status": "ready"
    }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and report ID in the `url` field of the response to your previous `GET` call. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the file `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!TIP]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=c445bca183a3d338dc1c5b85a3d484f5' > /tmp/seller_fill_and_delivery_publisher.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
