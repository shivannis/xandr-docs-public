# Brand company service

Each brand is associated with a company, which can be used for filtering and searching. You can use the read-only Brand Company Service to list these companies. Brand companies are used primarily in developing [Ad Profiles](ad-profile-service.md) that determine what brands are allowed to run on certain publishers' pages.

For more information about brands, see [Brand Service](brand-service.md).
