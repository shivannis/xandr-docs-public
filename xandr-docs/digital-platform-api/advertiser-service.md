# Advertiser service

The Advertiser service lets networks add, modify, and view the advertisers that interact with Xandr. Direct marketers rarely use the Advertiser service because they have only one advertiser (themselves).

| `control_pct` | double | The percentage of users in the control group for this advertiser. This must be expressed as a number between `0` and `1`, inclusive.

| `enable_pacing` | boolean | If `true`, then spending will be paced for this advertiser over the course of the day. |
| `enable_political_io_by_default` | boolean | Possible values: `0` or `1`.<br><br>If set to `true`, insertion orders created for this advertiser using the UI will have political advertising enabled by default.

| `labels` | array | The optional labels applied to the advertiser. Currently, three labels are available for advertisers: <br> - `"Salesperson"` <br> - `"Account Manager"` <br> - `"Advertiser Type"`. See [Labels](#labels) below for more details.<br><br>**Note**: You can report on advertiser labels with the [Network Analytics](./network-analytics.md) report. For example, if you use the "Salesperson" label to specify the name of the salesperson responsible for each advertiser, you can run the Network Analytics report filtered by `"salesperson_for_advertiser"` to focus on the advertisers that a particular salesperson is responsible for or grouped by `"salesperson_for_advertiser"` to rank the performance of your salespeople. |
| `last_modified` | timestamp | Timestamp of the last time this advertiser was modified. |

A profile set at the advertiser level will apply to all traffic for your advertiser, so you will probably want to keep this profile very broad. Ad calls must pass all profile targeting at any level. See the [Profile Service](./profile-service.md) for details. |
| `remarketing_segment_id` | int | A segment is marked as "remarketing" for reporting and filtering purposes only. If you mark a segment as remarketing in the UI, it will show up here. Or you can add segment IDs here, and they will be marked as remarketing for reporting purposes. |

For details on how to make the advertiser timezone "trickle down" to child objects, see [Timezone for Dependent Objects](#timezone-for-dependent-objects) below.<br><br>**Default**: `"EST5EDT"`, or the member's timezone. |

You will not be able to create insertion orders, if this field is set to `"false"`. Please see the [Insertion Order Service](./insertion-order-service.md) for details.<br><br>**CAUTION**:<br>**Preexisting line items**<br>If you set this field to `true` and have already created line items prior to enabling this setting, those line items will stop spending. To allow those line items to continue spending, create an insertion order (using the [Insertion Order Service](./insertion-order-service.md)) and associate the line items with the insertion order (using the [Line Item Service](./line-item-service.md)). All newly created line items will require an insertion order.<br><br>**Note**:<br>When the advertiser has associated insertion orders, you will not be able to update the value of `"use_insertion_orders"` to `false`.<br><br>**Default**: `true` |

### Third-party pixels

The `thirdparty_pixels` array contains fields in the table below. These fields are read-only. To update or create third-party pixels and/or attach third-party pixels to all creatives owned by the advertiser, use the [Third-party Pixel service](./third-party-pixel-service.md). To attach third-party pixels to individual creatives, use the [Creative Service](./creative-service.md).

| `audit_statu`s | string | Audit status of the pixel.<br>**Read Only**. |
| `id` | int | The pixel's ID.<br>**Read Only**. |
| `name` | string | The full name of the pixel.<br>**Read Only**. |

### Stats

The `stats` object has been deprecated (as of October 17, 2016). Use the [Report Service](./report-service.md) to obtain statistical information instead.

### Labels

You can use the read-only [Label Service](./label-service.md) to view all possible labels for advertisers, insertion orders, line items, campaigns, and publishers. This service allows you to view the labels that is already applied to your objects.

| Field | Type (Length) | Description |

### Pagination

You can request a certain number of objects through these fields:

```
"count": 8,
    "start_element": null,
    "num_elements": null
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `count` | int | How many objects are in this service? For example, 8 advertisers. |
| `num_elements` | int | How many elements to return? For example, start at object # 4 and return 3 objects, or # 4, 5, 6. |
| `start_element` | int | The number at which to start counting. |

### Default brand

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `category_id` | int | The ID of the brand's category. |
| `id` | int | The brand's ID. |
| `name` | string | The name of the brand. |

### Timezone for dependent objects

When you change an advertiser's timezone, you can choose whether or not to make the change "trickle down" to child objects (campaigns, line items, and creatives). To do this, you should pass `set_child_timezone=true` in the query string of the URL during your request to create or update the timezone.

For example:

```
$ curl -b cookies -X PUT -d @advertiser 'https://api.appnexus.com
/advertiser?id=111&set_child_timezone=true'
```

- If `true`, then timezone on all child objects is set to the Advertiser's timezone. Note that any timezone settings on lower-level objects (e.g., Insertion orders, Line Items, Campaigns) will be overridden with the Advertiser's timezone.
- If `false`, timezone is only set on the advertiser.
