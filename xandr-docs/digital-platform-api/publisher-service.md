# Publisher service

The Publisher Service is used to create and update your managed publishers.

## REST API

| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `POST` | [https://api.appnexus.com/publisher](https://api.appnexus.com/publisher)<br>(publisher JSON) | Add a new publisher (with a default site and placement). |
| `POST` | [https://api.appnexus.com/publisher?create_default_placement=false](https://api.appnexus.com/publisher?create_default_placement=false)<br>(publisher JSON) | Add a new publisher (without a default site and placement). |
| `PUT` | [https://api.appnexus.com/publisher?id=PUBLISHER_ID](https://api.appnexus.com/publisher?id=PUBLISHER_ID)<br>(publisher JSON) | Update an existing publisher. |
| `GET` | [https://api.appnexus.com/publisher](https://api.appnexus.com/publisher) | View all publishers. |
| `GET` | [https://api.appnexus.com/publisher?id=PUBLISHER_ID](https://api.appnexus.com/publisher?id=PUBLISHER_ID) | View a specific publisher. |
| `GET` | [https://api.appnexus.com/publisher?id=1,2,3](https://api.appnexus.com/publisher?id=1,2,3) | View multiple publishers by ID using a comma-separated list. |
| `DELETE` | [https://api.appnexus.com/publisher?id=PUBLISHER_ID](https://api.appnexus.com/publisher?id=PUBLISHER_ID) | Delete a publisher.<br><br>**Caution:** Deleting a publisher deletes all of its child objects as well, including sites, placements, payment rules, and publisher-level ad quality profiles. The deletions are permanent and cannot be reverted. Although deleted objects continue to be available in reporting, you will no longer have visibility into their specific settings. |
| `GET` | https://api.appnexus.com/publisher/meta | Find out which fields you can filter and sort by. |

If your API call returns an error with "**Request failed due to timeout or memory issue**", you can append `add_mappings=false` to your query parameters. Adding this parameter will only return the top-level API objects, but not their nested children.

For example:

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies "https://api.appnexus.com/publisher?id=2,3,5,8,13,21&add_mappings=false"
```

| `is_rtb` | boolean | All networks have one publisher object that serves as a so-called "plumbing link" to real-time inventory. This mock publisher has no ad profile, no ad quality rules, no visibility profiles, or any of the other trappings of an actual publisher. All other publishers have `is_rtb` set to `false` by default.<br>**Default:** `false` |

| `stats` | array | The `stats` object has been **deprecated** (as of October 17, 2016). Use the [Report Service](report-service.md) to obtain statistical information instead. |
| `max_learn_pct` | int | The maximum % of the publisher's daily volume that can be used for learn.<br><br>**Tip:** If you want us to automatically allocate an optimal percent of impressions to learn to keep introducing new offers as older offers become less profitable, set this field to `null`.<br><br>**Default:** `0` |

| `base_ad_quality_rule_id` | int | The unique identifier for the publisher's base ad quality rule. This acts as a "catch-all" ad quality rule in two cases:<br>- There are no conditional ad quality rules that match the current impression.<br>There are no conditional ad quality rules defined.<br>- If the `base_ad_quality_rule_id` is not defined, the system will use the ad profile associated with the `default_ad_profile_id` (defined above). For more information, see the [Ad Quality Rule Service](ad-quality-rule-service.md). |
| `currency` | enum | The publisher's currency.<br><br>**Warning:** This field can be set on `POST`, but it cannot be updated on `PUT`.<br><br>**Tip:** As a best practice, align currency to the billing currency in order to achieve the best possible local currency experience.<br><br>**Default:** Member's default currency or USD. |

For more details, see [Labels](#labels) below.<br><br>**Note:**<br>You can report on publisher labels with the [Network Analytics](network-analytics.md) report. For example, if you use the `"Salesperson"` label to specify the name of the salesperson responsible for each publisher, you could run the Network Analytics report filtered by `"salesperson_for_publisher"` to focus on the publishers that a particular salesperson is responsible for, or grouped by `"salesperson_for_publisher"` to rank the performance of your salespeople. |
| `placements` | array of objects | The placements associated with the publisher, including the default placement that is created with the publisher. When you create additional placements, or publisher tags, with the [Placement Service](placement-service.md), you associate them with a publisher. For more details, see [Placements](#placements) below. |
| `external_inv_codes` | array of objects | Some sellers use their own codes to break out their inventory more granularly than by Publisher > Site > Placement. This is done via the External Inventory Code Service. This field shows the external inventory codes associated with the publisher. |
| `cpm_reselling_disabled` | boolean | **Read-only.** If `true`, we have detected impression issues on this publisher's inventory and has therefore set `"allow_cpm_external"` to `false`, preventing the reselling of the publisher's inventory on a CPM basis.<br>**Default:** `false` |
| `cpc_reselling_disabled` | boolean | **Read-only.** If `true`, we have detected click issues on this publisher's inventory and has therefore set `"allow_cpc_external"` to `false`, preventing the reselling of the publisher's inventory on a CPC basis.<br>**Default:** `false` |
| `platform_ops_notes` | string | **Read-only.** Notes about the disabling of CPM/CPC reselling. |
| `pitbull_segment_id` | int | **Warning:** This field has been **deprecated**. |

For internal field definitions, see [Publisher Brand Exceptions](#publisher-brand-exceptions) below.<br>**Required On:** `n/a` |
| `seller_page_cap_enabled` | boolean | This field **must** be set in order to be able to enable page caps for this publisher. Page caps keep creatives associated with a given brand from serving more than once per page load, except for those brand IDs added to the `publisher_brand_exceptions` array on this service or the `member_brand_exceptions` array on the [Member Service](member-service.md).<br><br>**Note:** This setting activates the function but does not make the setting on the UI visible. To see this setting in the UI, contact your representative.<br><br>**Required On:** `n/a` |
| `inventory_relationship` | enum | The relationship of the inventory to the publisher. Possible values:<br>- `unknown`<br>- `owned_operated`<br>- `direct`<br>- `indirect_single_publisher`<br>- `indirect_multiple_publishers`<br><br>**Note:**<br>If both `is_oo` and `inventory_relationship` are specified, `inventory_relationship` will overwrite `is_oo` with the appropriate value based on the relationship.<br><br>**Required On:** `POST`/`PUT` |
| `inventory_source` | enum | The source of the inventory. Possible values:<br>- `other`<br>- `rubicon`<br>- `openx`<br>- `pubmatic`<br>- `aol`<br><br>If `inventory_source` is set to `other`, then `inventory_source_name` must be completed. |

### Stats

The `stats` object has been **deprecated** (as of October 17, 2016). Use the [Report Service](report-service.md) to obtain statistical information instead.

## Examples

### Add a new publisher

Create a JSON file with the required fields for a publisher.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Replace the placeholders (e.g., "PUBLISHER_NAME") in the below JSON example with your own values.
> - When you create a new publisher, a publisher id (`"id"` in the `"publisher"` object), `"default_site_id"`, default placement id (`"id"` in the `"placements"` array), and `"base_payment_rule_id"` are automatically generated.

Since the `inventory_relationship` field is required, we’ve set it to `“direct”`, (but it can be set to other values). We’ve also set `state` to `“inactive”` for now. Since we don’t provide the other publisher fields in our request, they will be set to their default values and display in the response body. For more information, see [Sell-Side Setup](sell-side-setup.md).
