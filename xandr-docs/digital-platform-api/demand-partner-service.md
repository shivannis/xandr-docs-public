# Demand partner service

The Demand Partner Service returns all demand partners for the caller's member. It enables the user to create a new demand partner and update or delete an existing demand partner.

In the context of PSP, demand partners, usually supply-side platforms (SSPs) like, create adapters for Prebid Server that receive and interpret header bidding ad requests. Demand partners hold an auction among their demand sources (usually demand-side-platforms (DSPs)) to collect bids on those ad requests and send the bids back to PSP, which holds another auction.

## REST API

| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `GET` | https://api.appnexus.com/prebid/demand-partner | Get all demand partners. |
| `POST` | https://api.appnexus.com/prebid/demand-partner | Create a new demand partner. |
| `PUT` | https://api.appnexus.com/prebid/demand-partner/{id} | Update an existing demand partner. |
| `PATCH` | https://api.appnexus.com/prebid/demand-partner/{id} | Update a portion of an existing demand partner. |
| `DELETE` | https://api.appnexus.com/prebid/demand-partner/{id} | Delete a demand partner. |

## GET

Get all or a specific demand partner. To retrieve a specific demand partner, append the demand partner ID as last component of the URL path. Returns a JSON array of demand partner objects.

A successful response will return JSON array of demand partner objects.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `bid_cpm_adjustment` | integer | A multiplier value applied to the Demand Partner's CPM bid price to adjust how the bids compete in auction. This does not change the actual bid or revenue payout, only the ranking of the bid in the auction. The default value is 1.00. In this case all partners' bids compete equally with no adjustments. The adjustment can be used to account for partner fees or for optimization. If you need CPM adjustments at a level more granular than Demand Partner, see [Create a Bias Rule](../monetize/create-a-bias-rule.md). |
| `deleted` | boolean | This indicates that the demand partner object has been deleted from the system. |
| `demand_partner_id` | integer | The ID of the demand partner on the Xandr platform.<br>**Note**: This now returns `null`. |
| `enabled` | boolean | Indicates if the demand partner is enabled or disabled. |
| `id` | integer | The demand partner ID specific to the caller's member. |
| `last_modified` | string | The date that the demand partner object was modified. |
| `member_id` | integer | The member ID. |
| `name` | string | The name of the demand partner. |
| `pub_id_settings` | object | The options relevant to the publisher-provided user IDs. See the [publisher provided ID settings](#publisher-provided-id-settings) table below. |

### Publisher provided ID settings

| Property | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|

## Managing identity sources

> [!NOTE]
> - Each identifier source must have permission at the Microsoft member, bidder (Prebid Server Premium, ID 443), and demand partner level in order to successfully pass through in requests to demand partners.
> - For more information on the identifier registration process and managing identifiers, review the [Identity Service API](./identity-service.md).
> - In the future, the Identity Management UI will allow for holistic management of identifier permissions.
> - This service currently is in Alpha. It is still under development and may be subject to change without notice. Contact your Microsoft Account Representative to get enabled.
