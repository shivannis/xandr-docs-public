# Advertiser attributed conversions

The Advertiser Attributed Conversions report allows you to view conversion pixel IDs, order IDs, times of attributed clicks or impressions, and other information related to your advertisers' attributed conversions.

> [!NOTE]
> Conversion pixels are used to track actions on advertisers' web pages, such as registering or making a purchase. They can be configured to pass dynamic order ID values, which help networks reconcile with advertisers. Once a conversion pixel fires, Xandr determines if the conversion can be attributed (tied to a creative that the user viewed or clicked previously). A post-click conversion is attributed to the last click on a creative associated with the conversion pixel. A post-view conversion is attributed to the last impression of a creative associated with the conversion pixel. For a hybrid pixel, the conversion is attributed to the last click or, if there were no clicks, the last impression of a creative associated with the conversion pixel.
>
> For more details about our attribution process, see [Conversion Attribution](../invest/conversion-attribution.md) in the UI documentation.

For instructions on retrieving a report, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md) or the [Examples](#examples).

This report is filtered by member ID and advertiser ID. The member ID is detected based on the network user's authentication, but the advertiser ID must be specified as part of the URL, for example:

```
https://api.appnexus.com/report?advertiser_id=ADVERTISER_ID
```

## Time frame and time zone

The `report_interval` field in the JSON request can be set to one of the following:

- current_hour
- last_hour
- today
- yesterday
- last_48_hours
- last_7_days
- last_30_days
- month_to_yesterday
- month_to_date
- last_30_days

Alternately, the `start_date` and `end_date` fields can be set to a range within the last 33 days. The `timezone` field in the JSON request can be set only to `UTC`, but this is not necessary, as the timezone defaults to `UTC` if not specified.

### Data retention period

This report can retrieve data for the last 90 days and only in UTC timezone.

## Examples

### Create the JSON-formatted report request

In this example, we set a filter to get information about conversion pixel 9012.

```
$ cat attributed_conversions  {
    "report":
    {
        "report_type": "attributed_conversions",
        "columns": [
            "datetime",
            "pixel_id",
            "order_id",
            "post_click_or_post_view_conv",
            "post_click_or_post_view_revenue",
            "line_item_id",
            "creative_id",
            "campaign_id",
            "imp_time",
            "imp_type_id",
            "advertiser_id",
            "buyer_member_id"
        ],
        "filters": [{"pixel_id": 9012}],
        "report_interval": "last_7_days",
        "emails": ["js@email.com"],
        "format": "csv"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the reporting service

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @attributed_conversions 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?advertiser_id=123'

{
    "response":{
        "status":"OK",
        "report_id":"07af1282c9485adcef49c95fa5d7496b"
    }
}
```

### Use the report ID to retrieve the report data

The standard response includes the report data and a Download URL that you can use to save the data to a file. If you want to get just the Download URL without the report data, pass `"without_data"` in the query string.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=07af1282c9485adcef49c95fa5d7496b'

If necessary, use the [Lookup Service](./lookup-service.md) to map objects IDs to other relevant data, such as names, codes, and statuses.

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the report ID, but this time to the `report-download` service. You can find the service and report ID in the url field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592' > /tmp/attributed_conversions.csv 
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
