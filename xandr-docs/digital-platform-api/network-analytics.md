# Network analytics

The Network Analytics report can be used to view both buy and sell-side data for a network member:

- Direct advertiser impressions (bought across direct publishers and real-time inventory)
- Direct publishers (sold across direct advertisers and other platform buyers)

To drill down into more granular analytics for a specific advertiser or publisher, see the [Network Advertiser Analytics](./network-advertiser-analytics.md) and [Network Publisher Analytics](./network-publisher-analytics.md) reports.

For instructions on retrieving a report, please see [Report Service](./report-service.md) or the [example](#example) below.

## Time frame

The `report_interval` field can be set to one of the following:

- current_hour
- last_hour
- today
- yesterday
- last_48_hours
- last_7_days
- last_30_days
- month_to_date
- month_to_yesterday
- last_2_days
- quarter_to_date
- last_month
- lifetime

**Data retention period**

Most data in this report is maintained permanently (exceptions noted below). After:

- 100 days, you are no longer able to report on hourly data. However, daily, monthly and cumulative intervals are still available.
- 14 months, you are no longer able to report on individual:
  - Creatives
  - Placements
  - Brands

In some cases Analytics reports can show delivery that does not match statistics shown elsewhere in Invest or Monetize for a given advertiser or publisher. This is due to the way that Analytics reporting data older than 100 days and 14 months are aggregated. The data from Billing reports are kept in non-aggregated form indefinitely. For more information, see [Dates and Times in Reporting](../curate/dates-and-times-in-reporting.md) in the UI documentation.

> [!NOTE]
> To run a report for a custom time frame, set the `start_date` and `end_date` fields in your report request. For more details about these fields, see [Report Service](./report-service.md).

**Time ranges including dates occurring greater than 45 days ago**

If you create network analytics reports with the `report_interval` set to `"lifetime"` or `"quarter_to_date"` (where the end date is greater than 45 days from today), your report (regardless of metrics included) will be added to a special queue for `"resource-intensive" `reports. As a result, the report may take longer than usual to complete. In addition, these resource-intensive reports may, due to the amount of data being requested, fail before being completed. If your report fails to complete, you will receive a notification. If your report request fails or is deleted, you can:

- re-run the report at a later time.
- use a report type other than `network_analytics`.
- alter the way you structure your reports (if possible) so they do not include dates greater than 45 days ago.

If you are frequently requesting network analytics reports via the API which include dates longer than 45 days ago, you may need to consider caching data and using [Bulk Reporting Feeds](./bulk-reporting-feeds.md) or [Log-Level Data (LLD) Feeds](../log-level-data/log-level-data-feeds.md).

## Example

### Create JSON formatted report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` `"network_analytics"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the format in which the data should be returned (`csv`, `excel`, or `html`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md).

```
{code}$ cat network_analytics

{
    "report":
    {
        "report_type":"network_analytics",
        "columns":[
            "hour",
            "seller_member_name",
            "buyer_member_name",
            "advertiser_name",
            "publisher_name",
            "imps",
            "clicks",
            "total_convs",
            "ctr",
            "convs_rate"
        ],
        "report_interval":"last_48_hours",
        "format":"csv"
    }
}
{code}
```

### `POST` the request to the reporting service

```
{code}$ curl -b cookies -X POST -d @network_analytics 'https://api.appnexus.com/report'
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"097f59fc3ab7d02c5d60db42081d9b69"
   }
}
{code}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service

Make a `GET` call with the report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the reporting data to a file (described in the next step).

```
Make a GET call with the Report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this GET call until the {{execution_status}} is "ready". Then use the *report-download* service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.
{code}$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=097f59fc3ab7d02c5d60db42081d9b69'

         "url": "report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592"
      },
      "execution_status":"ready"
   }
}
{code}
```

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and report ID in the `url` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!TIP]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
{code}$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592' > /tmp/network_analytics.csv{code}
```
