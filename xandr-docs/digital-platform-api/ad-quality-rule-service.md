# Ad quality rule service

An ad quality rule defines the ad quality settings which a network can define for its managed publishers. A network may have more than one ad quality rule applied conditionally across a publisher's inventory. For instance, traffic originating from certain geo-locations may require different ad quality settings.

## REST API

> [!NOTE]
>
> - publisher_code can be used in place of publisher_id, and ad_quality_rule_code can be used in place of ad_quality_rule_id for all of the calls below.
> - If an Ad Quality (AQ) is set as `"default_brand_status": "banned"` but the parent brand is set as `"status": "trusted"`, the child brand overrides the setting in `"default_brand_status"` and it will be able to serve unless it is explicitly banned in the Ad Profile's brand override list.
