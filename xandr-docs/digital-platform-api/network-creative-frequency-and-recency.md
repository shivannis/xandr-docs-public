# Network creative frequency and recency

The **Network Creative Frequency & Recency** report can be used to view creative data for a specific advertiser based on the frequency and recency of user views. This report is more granular than the [Advertiser Creative Frequency and Recency](./advertiser-creative-frequency-and-recency.md) report and is available to network users only.

For instructions on retrieving a report, see [Report Service](./report-service.md) or the [example](#example) below. This report requires specifying the advertiser ID as part of the URL, for example:

```
https://api.appnexus.com/report?advertiser_id=ADVERTISER_ID
```

## Time frame

The `report_interval` field can be set to one of the following:

- last_hour
- today
- yesterday
- last_48_hours
- last_2_days
- last_7_days
- last_14_days
- month_to_date
- last_30_days
- last_month
- last_100_days
- custom

### Data retention period

Data retention period for this report is 120 days (no data before February 26, 2017).

> [!NOTE]
> To run a report for a custom time frame, set the `start_date` and `end_date` fields in your report request. For more details about these fields, see [Report Service](./report-service.md).
