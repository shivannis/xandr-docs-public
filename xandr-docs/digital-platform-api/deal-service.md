# Deal service

The Deal Service lets buyers, sellers, and external bidders set up and manage negotiated deals. Deals may provide buyers:

- Preferential pricing on inventory
- Access to exclusive inventory
- Reduced competition on inventory
- Other opportunities

Each deal is valid for a single buyer.

> [!NOTE]
> - The inventory included in a deal may be encompassed by other deals as well.
> - Buyers can use the [Deal Buyer Access Service](./deal-buyer-access-service.md) to view the deals available to them. To target deals, buyers **Seller Restricted Targeting** can use the `deal_targets` field in the [Profile Service](./profile-service.md).

|:---|:---|:---|
| `id` | int | The ID of the creative that is approved or banned for the deal. You can use the [Creative Service](./creative-service.md) to retrieve creative IDs. |
| `status` | string | Specifies how this creative will be handled for this deal.<br>- `approved`: This creative can always serve in this deal, regardless of any other ad quality settings or overrides.<br> - `banned`: This creative can never serve in this deal, regardless of any other ad quality settings or overrides. |

### Ad server lists

Each `adserver_lists` object contains the following fields.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `id` | int | The ID of the ad server list that will be applied to this deal.<br>**Required On**: `POST` |
| `name` | string | The name of the ad server list. |
| `override` | boolean | If `true`, apply this ad server list to the deal. |

### Seller restricted targeting

A deal can specify which attributes an Invest buyer is allowed to target whilst also targeting this deal. The options are:

- no restrictions - Invest buyers can target all attributes on their line item whilst targeting this deal.
- some restrictions - Invest buyers can target certain attributes on their line item.
- all restrictions - Invest buyers can target no other attributes whilst targeting this deal.

Your member may be configured to use one of these settings by default when new deals are created.

| Field | Type (Length) | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `id` | int | Possible values are:<br> - `1` (no restrictions)<br> - `2` (some restrictions)<br> - `3` (all restrictions) |
| `name` | string | **Read Only**. The name of the configured targeting restrictions (see `id`). |

If a deal is configured for some restrictions, the visibility profile associated with the deal (see the `visibility_profile_id` field in the [JSON Fields](#json-fields) section) determines the selection of attributes a buyer can target. The following visibility profile fields may be used to restrict a buyer's allowed targeting:

| Field | Targeting restrictions for Invest buyers |
|:---|:---|
| `expose_city_default` | City |
| `expose_datetime_default` | Daypart |
| `expose_device_type_default` | Device Type |
| `expose_dma_default` | DMA |
| `expose_postal_code_default` | Postal code, postal code lists, political districts |
| `expose_segment_groups_default` | Segments |
| `expose_state_default` | Region |
| `expose_video_content_duration_default` | Video Content Duration (e.g. long-form, short-form) |
| `expose_video_content_genres_default` | Video Content Genres |
| `expose_video_content_networks_default` | Video Content Network |
| `expose_video_content_ratings_default` | Video Content Ratings |
| `expose_video_context_default` | Video Context (e.g. pre-roll, mid-roll, etc.) |
| `expose_video_delivery_types_default` | Video Delivery Type (e.g. live, VOD) |
| `expose_video_program_types_default` | Video Program Types |

> [!NOTE]
> - Any targeting restrictions defined with the fields above will be applied to all buyers on the deal regardless of any buyer member-level or bidder-level overrides configured on the visibility profile.
> - Also, sellers cannot simultaneously enable Data Protection (see the `data_protected` field in the [JSON Fields](#json-fields) section) and [Seller Restricted Targeting](#seller-restricted-targeting) features on the same deal.

### Modify a deal

In this example, we add another eligible brand to the deal and we extend the end date.

```
$ cat deal_update
 
{
    "deal": {
        "end_date": "2017-01-31 23:59:59",
        "brands": [

                },
            {
                "id": 5
            }
            ]
    }
}
 
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X PUT -d @deal_update.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/deal?id=64'
{

            "size_preference": null
        }
    }
}
```

### Modify a deal to add overrides and ban certain creatives

In this example, we update a deal to allow user- and auto-initiated audio creatives to always serve regardless of ad quality settings. We also specifically ban two creative IDs.

```
$ cat deal_override
 
{
    "deal": {
        "id": 201,
        "technical_attributes": [
            {

                "name": "Audio: user-initiated",
                "override": true
            },
            {
                "id": 8,
                "name": "Audio: auto-initiated",
                "override": true
            }

            },
            {
                "id": 123456,
                "status": "banned"
            }
