## Examples

### Create JSON formatted report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` `"video_pod_analytics_network"`, as well as the `columns` (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filters for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the format in which the data should be returned (`csv`, `excel`, or `html`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](report-service.md).

```
$ cat video_pod_analytics_network
  {
    "report":
    {
        "report_type":"video_pod_analytics_network",
        "columns":[
            "hour",
            "ad_slot_type",
            "buyer_member",
            "imps"
        ],
        "report_interval":"last_48_hours",
        "format":"csv"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the Reporting service

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @video_ad_pod 'https://api.appnexus.com/report'
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"097f59fc3ab7d02c5d60db42081d9b69"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the Report service

Make a `GET` call with the Report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `{{execution_status}}` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.


```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=097f59fc3ab7d02c5d60db42081d9b69'
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report":{
         "name":null,
         "created_on":"2010-05-25 19:19:53",
         "json_request":"{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"video_pod_analytics_network\",\"columns\":[\"hour\",\"ad_slot_type\",
            \"buyer_member\",\"imps\",
            \"report_interval\":\"last_48_hours\"}}",
         "url": "report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592"
      },
      "execution_status":"ready"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the Report Download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the Report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and Report ID in the `url` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!TIP]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592' > /tmp/video_pod_analytics_network.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
