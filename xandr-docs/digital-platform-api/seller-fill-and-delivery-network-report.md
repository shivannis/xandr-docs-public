# Digital Platform API - Seller fill and delivery network report

The Seller Fill and Delivery Report was designed as a troubleshooting tool to provide sellers granular information regarding all impressions sent to Xandr for auction and to help diagnose delivery issues all the way down to the tag and domain level. Using the new descriptive fields, it is possible to see an approximation of overall fill rate on Xandr using the “Total Ad Responses" and "Total Ad Requests” metrics.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - This report only provides directional guidance on potential areas to troubleshoot. Figures in this report might see slight discrepancies with other standard reports, including the Network Analytics Report and the Video Analytics Report.
> - We recommend viewing each report independently and not comparing the directional figures from the Seller Fill and Delivery Report with other Xandr reporting, to avoid unnecessary confusion.

The data contained in this report will help pinpoint issues contributing to untransacted impressions stemming from:

- Improper default/passback tag setup
- Inventory blocklists related to IP or domain blocking
- Video player errors etc.

> [!NOTE]
> **For video sellers only**: As a result of video caching by video players, the Xandr data pipeline allows a six-hour window to register a response from a video player after the auction is complete and the creative VAST XML has been sent to the page, before considering a video impression ‘non-responsive’ (Bid Sent No Response). Xandr will update some counts, for video tags only, six hours after the time of the auction. Therefore, to receive the most accurate view of video counts across dimensions, schedule your reports to run after the six-hour window for a given hour of data.

## Example

### Create the JSON report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` of `"seller_fill_and_delivery_network"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the format in which the data should be returned (`csv`, `excel`, or `html`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md).

```
$ cat seller_fill_and_delivery_network

{"report":
    {
        "format": "csv",
        "report_interval": "yesterday",
        "row_per": ["geo_country"],
        "columns":["placement_id","imps_kept","total_ad_responses","total_ad_requests","geo_country"],
        "report_type": "seller_fill_and_delivery_network"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the [Report Service](./report-service.md)

`POST` the JSON request to get back a report ID.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X post -d @seller_fill_and_delivery_network "https://api.appnexus.com/report"

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"c445bca183a3d338dc1c5b85a3d484f5"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service

Make a `GET` call with the report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=c445bca183a3d338dc1c5b85a3d484f5'

{
    "response": {
        "status": "OK",
        "report": {
            "name": null,
            "created_on": "2014-11-19 22:33:31",
            "json_request": "{\"report\":{\"format\":\"csv\",\"report_interval\":\"yesterday\",\"row_per\":[\"geo_country\"],\"columns\":[\"placement_id\",\"imps_kept\",\"total_ad_responses\",\"total_ad_requests\",\"geo_country\"],\"report_type\":\"seller_fill_and_delivery_network\",\"filters\":[{\"seller_member_id\":\"958\"}]}}",
            "url": "report-download?id=c445bca183a3d338dc1c5b85a3d484f5"
        },
        "execution_status": "ready"
    }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and reportID in the `url` field of the response to your previous `GET` call. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the file `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!TIP]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=c445bca183a3d338dc1c5b85a3d484f5' > /tmp/seller_fill_and_delivery_network.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
