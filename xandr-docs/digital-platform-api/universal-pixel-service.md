# Universal Pixel service

The Universal Pixel Service is a set of REST API services that give you access to one or more Universal Pixels and any associated audiences and conversions.

## Universal Pixel service overview

The Universal Pixel provides insights into the interactions that users have with your website so you can easily segment these users, measure actions they take, and better target your ads. The Universal Pixel Service has three sets of endpoints:

- [Universal-Pixel REST API](#universal-pixel-rest-api) - To create, delete, view, and update a Universal Pixel.
- [Audience REST API](#audience-rest-api) - To create, delete, view, and update an audience.
- [Conversion REST API](#conversion-rest-api) - To create, delete, view, and update a conversion.

See below for [examples](#examples) of each Universal Pixel endpoint.

### Universal Pixel REST API (endpoint)

You can create a Universal Pixel using the **`/universal-pixel`** endpoint. Once a Universal Pixel is created, you can use the **`/universal-pixel`** endpoint to view it, update it, or delete it.

### Audience REST API (endpoint)

You can create a Universal Pixel audience using **`/universal-pixel/audience`** endpoint. Once an audience is created, you can use the **`/universal-pixel/audience`** endpoint to view it, updated it, or delete it.

### Conversion REST API (endpoint)

You create a Universal Pixel conversion using **`/universal-pixel/conversion`** endpoint. Once a conversion is created, you can use the **`/universal-pixel/conversion`** endpoint to view it, updated it, or delete it.
