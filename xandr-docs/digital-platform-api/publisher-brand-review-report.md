## Examples

### Create the JSON report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` of `"publisher_brand_review"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the `"format"` in which the data should be returned (`"csv"`, `"excel"`, or `"html"`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](report-service.md).

```
$ cat publisher_brand_review

{"report": 
    {
        "format": "csv",
        "report_interval": "yesterday",
        "row_per": ["placement_id"],
        "columns": ["placement_id","imp_type","creative_id","brand_id"],
        "report_type": "publisher_brand_review"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the [Report service](report-service.md)

`POST` the JSON request to get back a report ID.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X post -d @publisher_brand_review "https://api.appnexus.com/report?publisher_id=384186"

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"97a181df6d77a8f3cd5a45eff4ea3dab"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the Report service

Make a `GET` call with the report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=97a181df6d77a8f3cd5a45eff4ea3dab'

{
    "response": {
        "status": "OK",
        "report": {
            "name": null,
            "created_on": "2014-11-19 21:57:00",
            "json_request": "{\"report\":{\"format\":\"csv\",\"report_interval\":\"yesterday\",\"row_per\":[\"placement_id\"],\"columns\":[\"placement_id\",\"imp_type\",\"creative_id\",\"brand_id\"],\"report_type\":\"publisher_brand_review\",\"filters\":[{\"seller_member_id\":\"958\"},{\"publisher_id\":\"384186\"}]}}",
            "url": "report-download?id=97a181df6d77a8f3cd5a45eff4ea3dab"
        },
        "execution_status": "ready"
    }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the Report Download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and report ID in the `url` field of the response to your previous `GET` call. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the file format that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!NOTE]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=97a181df6d77a8f3cd5a45eff4ea3dab' > /tmp/publisher_brand_review.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
