# Digital Platform API - Saved Report service

The Saved Report service can be used to create new reports which are saved and can be retrieved at any time. They are useful for reports which are executed frequently. The Saved Report Service acts as a wrapper around the [Report Service](report-service.md).

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100K rows per report.

A few facts to keep in mind about saved reports:

- Saved reports expire after 6 months. You must create a new saved report after 6 months.
- Saved reports cannot have a **Lifetime** or **Custom** date range.
- Saved reports are run in the order in which they were originally created. For example, if you create two daily reports, the daily report created first will run first each day.
- Daily reports are run and sent each day at varying times throughout the day.
- Weekly reports are run and sent on the Monday of each week for the previous 7 days.
- Monthly reports are run and sent on the first day of each month.
