> The Adjustment Service is used to make changes to booked revenue and media cost values in reporting.

## Adjustment types

You can currently make three types of reporting adjustments:

### Advertiser adjustments

- `advertiser_revenue` - This adjustment type changes the booked revenue and/or impressions, clicks, and conversions you see in reporting for an advertiser **and** adjusts your media cost payout to revshare publishers. See the first [example](#examples) below for more details about how payout to revshare publishers is adjusted.
- `advertiser_credit` - This adjustment type changes the booked revenue and/or impressions, clicks, and conversions you see in reporting for an advertiser. It does **not** adjust your media cost payout to revshare publishers.

### Publisher adjustments

`"publisher"` - This adjustment type changes the media cost and/or impressions, clicks, and conversions you see in reporting for a publisher.

## Adjustment status

Adjustments are applied asynchronously to reporting and will appear several hours from the time they are created. The Adjustment Service provides an interface to check the current status of an adjustment.

> [!NOTE]
> In order for Adjustments to be processed the associated objects must be active. For example, if a line item is inactive the associated adjustment jobs will not be executed.

Status can be one of the following values:

| Status | Description |

| `new` | Adjustment has been entered into the system. |
| `pending` | Adjustment has been picked up for processing. |
| `processing` | Adjustment is being processed. |
| `propagating` | Adjustment is complete and is propagating to reporting caches. |
| `completed` | Adjustment is complete and should be available in reporting. |
| `failed` | Error while processing adjustment. |
| `cancelled` | User cancelled adjustment. |

## Examples

#### Adjusting advertiser revenue and impression count with attribution to publishers

For `"advertiser_revenue"` adjustments, attribution of booked revenue adjustments to revshare publishers is done proportionally based on the number of impressions served by a publisher.

> [!NOTE]
> - Advertiser runs a $1 CPM Line Item.
> - Xandr records 10,000 impressions and $10 booked revenue for this line item, served across 3 publishers.
> - Advertiser records 9,000 impressions and offers to pay $9.

*Report before adjustment*

| Advertiser Line Item | Publisher | Payment Rule | Impressions | Booked Revenue | Media Cost |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| $1 CPM Line Item | Publisher 1 | 60% Revshare Payment Rule | 1,000 | $1.00 | $0.60 |
| $1 CPM Line Item | Publisher 2 | 60% Revshare Payment Rule | 5,000 | $5.00 | $3.00 |
| $1 CPM Line Item | Publisher 3 | $0.50 CPM Payment Rule | 1,000 | $1.00 | $0.50 |
| $1 CPM Line Item | Publisher 4 | 70% Revshare Payment Rule | 3,000 | $3.00 | $2.10 |

To adjust revenue down to $9 and impressions to 9,000 for the line item, you create and `POST` the following JSON-formatted file:

```
$ cat adjustment
  
{
   "adjustment": {
      "adjustment_type": "advertiser_revenue",
      "line_item_id": 4243,
      "booked_revenue": 9.00,
      "imps": 9000
      "start_date": "2011-01-01 00:00:00",
      "end_date": "2011-01-01 23:59:59",
      "note": "This is a note..."
   }
}
  
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @adjustment 'https://api.appnexus.com/adjustment'
```

*Report after adjustment*

| Advertiser Line Item | Publisher | Payment Rule | Adjusted Impressions | Adjusted Booked Revenue | Adjusted Media Cost |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| $1 CPM Line Item | Publisher 1 | 60% Revshare Payment Rule | 1,000 | $0.90 | $0.54 |
| $1 CPM Line Item | Publisher 2 | 60% Revshare Payment Rule | 5,000 | $4.50 | $2.70 |
| $1 CPM Line Item | Publisher 2 | $0.50 CPM Payment Rule | 1,000 | $0.90 | $0.50 |
| $1 CPM Line Item | Publisher 3 | 70% Revshare Payment Rule | 3,000 | $2.70 | $1.89 |
| $1 CPM Line Item | - | - | -1,000 | $0.00 | $0.00 |

> [!NOTE]
> - We insert an additional row for changes to impression, click, or conversion counts. This row will appear in network reporting when grouping by Publisher. However, this row will not appear in reports run by Advertisers because they cannot group by Publisher.
>
> - Media cost is *not* adjusted for publishers paid on a cpm basis, or to payments to other platform members.
