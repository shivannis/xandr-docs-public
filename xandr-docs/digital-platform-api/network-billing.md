# Network billing

> [!WARNING]
> This report has been deprecated. As a result, it should only be used for billing activity **prior** to October 1, 2015. For reports after October 1, 2015, consult the [Buying Billing Report](buying-billing-report.md) and the [Selling Billing Report](./selling-billing-report.md).
>
> The **Network Billing Analytics** report can be used to view billing data across:
>
> - Direct advertiser impressions (bought across direct publishers and real-time inventory)
> - Direct publishers (sold across direct advertisers and other platform buyers)
>
> For instructions on retrieving a report, please see [Report Service](./report-service.md).
> [!NOTE]
> For impressions older than 100 days, the Network Billing Report now returns default values in some columns:
>
> - Creatives are aggregated into one row with `0` as the `creative_id` and a generic `creative_name`.
> - Placements are aggregated into one row with `-1` as the `placement_id` and a generic `placement_name`.
> - `hour` - Hourly data is aggregated into one row with 'YYYY-MM-DD 00:00:00' as the hour ('YYYY-MM-DD' is the UTC day in which the  activity happened). This will make it look as though all activity happened at midnight. All daily data older than 100 days will be returned in the UTC time zone.

## Example

### Create a JSON formatted report request

The JSON file should include the report_type `"network_analytics"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the format in which the data should be returned (`csv`, `excel`, or `html`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md).

```
$ cat network-billing-request.json

{
    "report": {
        "format": "csv",
        "report_interval": "last_48_hours",
        "columns": [
            "seller_member_id",
            "buyer_member_id",
            "imps",
            "clicks",
            "convs_rate"
        ],
        "report_type": "network_billing"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the reporting service

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @network-billing-request.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/report'

{
    "response": {
        "status": "OK",
        "report_id": "a2add615a52f0ca4ed13f64ce9d94a5c",
        "existing": false
    }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service

Make a `GET` call with the report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the reporting data to a file (described in the next step).

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=097f59fc3ab7d02c5d60db42081d9b69'

{
    "response": {
        "status": "OK",
        "report": {
            "name": "",
            "created_on": "2014-04-07 15:51:19",
            "json_request": "{\"report\":{\"format\":\"csv\",\"report_interval\":\"last_48_hours\",\"columns\":[\"seller_member_id\",\"buyer_member_id\",\"imps\",\"clicks\",\"convs_rate\"],\"report_type\":\"network_billing\",\"filters\":[{\"entity_member_id\":\"1309\"}]}}",
            "url": "https://hb.nym1.sand-08.adnxs.net/report-download?id=a2add615a52f0ca4ed13f64ce9d94a5c"
        },
        "execution_status": "ready"
    }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the report ID, but this time to the `report-download` service. You can find the service and report ID in the `url` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!TIP]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=a2add615a52f0ca4ed13f64ce9d94a5c > /tmp/network-billing-report.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
