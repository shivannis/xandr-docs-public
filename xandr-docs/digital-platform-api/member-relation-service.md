# Member relation service

> [!NOTE]
> This service is currently available to a limited set of clients and Microsoft employees only. This includes both clients and partners, as well as individual buyers and sellers. For example, a buyer member may want to set up a direct clearing relationship with a seller member rather than clearing through our platform.

In addition, the `apply_bid_landscape_priority` field allows sellers who are [Bid Landscape Feed](../log-level-data/bid-landscape-feed.md) clients to see all bids from a specific buyer in their bid landscape feed.

> [!NOTE]
> - The `member_relation` database table, upon which this API service is based, replaces the functionality of the legacy `member_clearing` table. The `member_clearing` table is no longer used.
> - You must go through Sales Ops to set up or edit a direct clear relationship because there is an impact on client billing and contracts. Setting up and/or editing a direct clear relationship without permission from Sales Ops could cause Xandr to get into financial or legal trouble with clients. If Sales Ops has given the green light, then Justin Pines or an IC will make the update.

### View all of a member's financial relationships where it acts as a buyer (or seller)

In this example, we view all of a member's relationships where it acts as the buyer from other sellers; in order to view all of the relationships wherein it acts as the seller to other buying members, change the parameter to `seller_member_id` instead:
