## Examples

### Create the JSON-formatted report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` `"buyer_invoice_report"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the format in which the data should be returned (`csv`, `excel`, or `html`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](report-service.md).

```
$ cat buyer_invoice_report.json

{
    "report": {
        "format": "csv",
        "report_interval": "last_48_hours",
        "columns": [
            "seller_member_name",
            "buyer_member_name",
            "imps",
            "clicks",
            "convs"
        ],
        "report_type": "buyer_invoice_report"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the Reporting Service specifying a member ID by replacing `INSERT_DESIRED_MEMBER_ID`

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @buyer_invoice_report.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?member_id=INSERT_DESIRED_MEMBER_ID'

{
 "response": {
   "status": "OK",
   "report_id": "39c4855a07e92433947886b5aabd267d", <=== COPY THIS report_id as you will need it to check the status of your report and to download your report
   "existing": false,
   "dbg_info": {
     ...
     }
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the Report Service

Make a `GET` call with the Report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=39c4855a07e92433947886b5aabd267d'

```

### `GET` the report data from the Report Download Service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the Report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and Report ID in the `url` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!NOTE]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=39c4855a07e92433947886b5aabd267d' > buyer_invoice_report.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
