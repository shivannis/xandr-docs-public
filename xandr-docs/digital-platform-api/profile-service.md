# Profile service overview

A profile is a set of targeting parameters, such as gender, age, geography, and frequency. It can be applied to several objects in the
system, most of which are listed below. The most common use of the profile service is to run a campaign; you create a profile and then
associate it with the [Campaign Service](campaign-service.md). The campaign object includes fields such as flight dates and associated creatives.

- Except for segment targeting, parameters are absolute. For example, if the geographical target is set only to the United States, ONLY U.S.-based impressions will receive bids.
- Segment targeting uses and/or Boolean logic.
- Profiles must be associated with either an advertiser or a publisher, in order to be used with several other objects in the system, listed below.

Profiles can be used with several other objects in the system (listed below). Any fields in the profile that do not apply to the associated object will be ignored.

- Advertiser
- Line Item
- Creative
- Campaign
- Payment Rule
- Ad Quality Rule

It is also possible to refer to a profile within a deal object, while it is not necessary for the profile to be associated to an advertiser or publisher.

## JSON fields

### General

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `id` | int | The ID of the profile.<br>**Required:** `PUT`, in query string. |
| `code` | string | Custom code for the profile. |
| `description` | string | Optional description. |
| `is_template` | Boolean | If `true`, the profile has been saved as a targeting template in. To get profiles that are targeting templates in, pass `is_template=true` in the query string of a `GET` call. For more details about targeting templates in, see "[Managing Targeting Templates](../monetize/managing-targeting-templates.md)" within the app's Help System.<br>**Default:** `false` |
| `last_modified` | timestamp | Time of last modification to this profile. |
| `is_archived` | boolean | **Read-only.** Indicates whether the profile has been automatically archived due to it's parent line item not being used (and therefore, having been archived). Once set as `true`, the value can't be changed and the only calls that can be made on the profile object are `GET` and `DELETE`.<br><br>**Note:** If a profile's parent is automatically archived, the profile will also be archived. In addition, once archived, the profile may not be associated with any line items or campaigns.<br>**Default:** `false` |
| `archived_on` | timestamp | **Read-only.** The date and time on which the profile was archived (i.e., when the `is_archived` field was set to `true`).<br>**Default:** `null` |

### Frequency

For details on Frequency and Recency Targeting and the below fields, see [here](frequency-for-the-api.md).

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `max_lifetime_imps` | int | The maximum number of impressions per person. If set, this value must be between `0` and `255`.<br>**Default:** `null` |
| `min_session_imps` | int | The minimum number of impressions per person per session. If set, this value must be between `0` and `255`.<br>**Default:** `null` |
| `max_session_imps` | int | The maximum number of impressions per person per session. If set, this value must be between `0` and `255`.<br>**Default:** `null` |
| `max_day_imps` | int | The maximum number of impressions per person per day. If set, this value must be between `0` and `255`.<br>**Default:** `null` |
| `max_hour_imps` | int | The maximum number of impressions per person per hour. If set, this value must be between `0` and `255`.<br>**Default:** `null` |
| `max_week_imps` | int | The maximum number of impressions per person per week. If set, this value must be between `0` and `255`.<br>**Default:** `null` |
| `max_month_imps` | int | The maximum number of impressions per person per month. If set, this value must be between `0` and `255`.<br>**Default:** `null` |
| `min_minutes_per_imp` | int | The minimum number of minutes between impressions per person. This field may not be set to `0`.<br>**Default:** `null` |
| `max_page_imps` | int | The maximum number of impressions per page load (seller's ad request).<br><br>**Note:** Only relevant for multi-tag auctions (For example: /(ss)vmap).<br>**Default:** `null` |
| `require_cookie_for_freq_cap` | Boolean | Indicates whether or not you'll exclusively serve to users with cookies in order to maintain your frequency cap settings, as we can't track the number of impressions without cookies.<br>Setting this field to `true` indicates that you'll only serve ads to users with cookies, thereby maintaining your frequency settings. Setting this field to `false` indicates that you'll serve to cookieless users as well, thereby ignoring frequency-cap settings for those users. Because this flag is only enforced when a frequency cap has been set, setting this field to `true` won't require cookies for an object that has no active frequency-cap settings.<br><br>**Note:** If you've set a daily-occurring frequency cap and are going to use Advanced Frequency Management, you must set `advanced_frequency_management` to `true` and `require_cookie_for_freq_cap` to `false`.<br><br>**Default:** `true` |

### Targeting

When multiple targets are set, only inventory that satisfies all targeting criteria is eligible. For example, if you target intended
audience `general` and inventory sources x, y, and z, then the profile will only target `general` audience inventory from inventory sources x, y, and z.

> [!NOTE]
> You may not specify both the `segment_targets` and `segment_group_targets` fields in any `POST` or `PUT` calls (only one of the two may be specified).
>
> - Please be aware that some targets accept an array of **objects** rather than integers or strings. The format can be found in the examples at the bottom of this page.
> - For **Programmatic Guaranteed Buying Line Items**:
>   - You can only target one deal target (see [Deal Targets](#deal-targets) below) and the `allow_unaudited` field must be set to `true`.
>   - **Do not set any other targeting fields**.
> - For [Augmented Line Items](line-item-service.md), it is mandatory to set at least one country as geography targeting (See [Country Targets](#country-targets) below).
> - **Effective August 30, 2021**:
>   - TapAd's Graph will provide global coverage excluding Europe.
>   - Xandr's Graph will provide coverage for Europe and the United States.
>
>     Please adjust your code accordingly.

### Targeting results for `deal_action_include` AND `deal_targets` fields

The following targeting results occur for these values of the `deal_action_include` AND `deal_targets` fields:

| `deal_action_include` | `deal_targets` | Targeting Result |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `true` | `null` | Target no deals |
| `false` | `null` | Target all deals |
| `true` | Contains deal targets | Include these deals in targeting |
| `false` | Contains deal targets | Exclude these deals in targeting |

### Mobile app instance targets

For more information about mobile app instances, including instructions on adding them to your profile, see the [Mobile App Instance Service](mobile-app-instance-service.md).

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `id` | int | The unique ID of the mobile app instance. |
| `bundle_id` | string | The bundle ID of this mobile app instance. |
| `os_family_id` | int | The OS family ID associated with this mobile app instance. |

### Mobile app instance list targets

For more information about mobile app instance lists, including nstructions on adding them to your profile, see the [Mobile App Instance List Service](mobile-app-instance-service.md).

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `id` | int | The unique ID of the mobile app instance list. |
| `name` | string | The name of this mobile app instance list. |
| `description` | string | An optional description of the list's purpose or contents. |

### Daypart targets

Each object in the `daypart_targets` array includes the following fields. For formatting, see the [View a profile](#view-a-profile) example below.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `day` | enum | The day of the week. <br>Possible values: `sunday`, `monday`, `tuesday`, `wednesday`, `thursday`, `friday`, `saturday`, or `all`. <br><br>**Note:** These strings must be in lower case. |
| `start_hour` | int | The start hour for the daypart. This must be an integer between `0` and `23`. The campaign will start serving at the beginning of the hour (`6` is equivalent to `"6:00"` am). |
| `end_hour` | int | The end hour for the daypart. This must be an integer between `0` and `23`. The campaign will stop serving at the end of the hour (`23` is equivalent to `"23:59"`). |

### Segment targets

You define the Boolean logic between segments with `segment_boolean_operator` field outside of the array. If `segment_boolean_operator` is `AND`, then the profile will only target users that satisfy all segment targets. If the `segment_boolean_operator` is `OR`, then the profile will target users that satisfy any of the specified segments. For detailed guidance on Boolean logic for segment targeting, see Segment Targeting.

In segment targeting, you need to keep the settings for the Boolean logic consistent, otherwise you would not be able to edit the segments in Microsoft Invest UI. For consistent Boolean logic settings, you need to ensure that

- `segment_boolean_operator` field is set as either “`and`” or “`or`”.
- The `boolean_operator` field in each object of the segment_group_targets array (See Segment Group Targets) is set as either “`and`” or “`or`”. However this value should be the opposite of what is set in `segment_boolean_operator` above. For example, if the value set in segment_boolean_operator is "`or`", the value of `boolean_operator` for the objects should be "`and`".
- The value of `boolean_operator` field for all objects in the segment_group_targets array needs to be same. In short, you cannot have boolean_operator of one object as "`and`" and other as "`or`" in the same profile. For an example of consistent and inconsistent JSONs, see below.

```

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `id` | int | The ID of the segment.<br>**Required On:** `POST` |
| `code` | string | The custom code for the segment. |
| `action` | enum | Possible values: `include` or `exclude`.<br>**Default:** `include` |
| `start_minutes` | int | The lower bound for the amount of time since a user was added to the segment.<br>**Default:** `0` |
| `expire_minutes` | int | The upper bound for the amount of time since a user was added to the segment.<br>**Default:** `-1` |
| `other_equals` | int | The exact segment value to target.<br><br>**Note:** If you use `other_in_list`, you cannot use this field.<br>**Default:** `null` |
| `other_less` | int | The non-inclusive upper bound for segment value targeting.<br>**Default:** `null` |
| `other_greater` | int | The non-inclusive lower bound for segment value targeting.<br>**Default:** `null` |
| `other_in_list` | array | The list of segment values to target.If you use `other_equals`, you cannot use this field.<br>**Default:** `null` |

> [!NOTE]
> For `other_equals`, `other_less`, `other_greater`, and `other_in_list`, the segment value can be an "other" value passed by the segment pixel or can be related to segment query string values (see the "querystring_mapped" field in the [Segment Service](segment-service.md)). For examples of how to target query string values in a segment, see other examples below.

**Example**:

In this example, since the `segment_boolean_operator` is `AND`, the profile will target only users that fit in both segment 86 and segment 202.

```
{
   "profile":{
      "segment_boolean_operator":"and",
      "segment_targets":[
         {
            "id":86,

         }
      ]
   }
}
```

### Segment group targets

Each segment group object contains the following fields.

> [!NOTE]
> You define the Boolean logic between groups with the `segment_boolean_operator` field outside of the array, and you define the Boolean logic between segments in a group with the `boolean_operator` field within the group object. See the example below for formatting and for an example of the logic of combining `segment_boolean_operator` and `boolean_operator`. For detailed guidance on Boolean logic for segment targeting, see [Segment Targeting](../monetize/segment-targeting.md).
>
> Null segments cannot be added.
>
> You may not add `null` segments to this array using `POST` or `PUT`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `boolean_operator` | enum | The boolean logic between segments in a segment group. Possible values: `and` or `or`. <br>The value of `boolean_operator` field for all objects in the `segment_group_targets` array needs to be same.<br>In short, you cannot have `boolean_operator` of one object as `"and"` and other as `"or"` in the same profile.<br>**Default:** `or`<br>**Required:** `POST` |
| `id` | int | The ID of the segment.<br>**Required:** `POST` |
| `code` | string | The custom code for the segment. |
| `action` | enum | Possible values: `include` or `exclude`.<br>**Default:** `include` |
| `start_minutes` | int | The lower bound for the amount of time since a user was added to the segment.<br>**Default:** `0` |
| `expire_minutes` | int | The upper bound for the amount of time since a user was added to the segment.<br>**Default:** `-1`  |
| `other_equals` | string | The exact segment value to target.<br><br>**Note:** If you use `other_in_list`, you cannot use this field.<br>**Default:** `null` |
| `other_less` | int | The non-inclusive upper bound for segment value targeting.<br>**Default:** `null` |
| `other_greater` | int | The non-inclusive lower bound for segment value targeting.<br>**Default:** `null` |
| `other_in_list` | array | The list of segment values to target.<br><br>**Note:** If you use `other_equals`, you cannot use this field.<br>**Default:** `null` |

> [!NOTE]
> For `other_equals`, `other_less`, `other_greater`, and `other_in_list`, the segment value can be an `"other"` value passed by the segment pixel or can be related to segment query string values (see the `"querystring_mapped"` field in the [Segment Service](segment-service.md)). For examples of how to target query string values in a segment, see other examples below.

**Example**:

In this example, since the `segment_boolean_operator` is `OR` and the `boolean_operator` for each group is `AND`, the profile will target only users that fit in both segment 11 and segment 22 or both segment 33 and segment 44.

`video_frameworks` arrays.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `allow_unknown_playback_method` | Boolean | Use this field to target inventory where the playback method is unknown. Set this field to `true` when using the fields of the `playback_method` array to target specific playback methods AND when you want to include inventory for which no playback method information has been provided.<br>If you are not targeting specific playback methods, this field will have no effect on targeting.<br>**Default:** `false` |
| `allow_unknown_context` | Boolean | Use this field to target inventory where the context is unknown. Set this field to `true` when using the fields of the `contexts` array to target specific contexts AND when you want to include inventory for which no context information has been provided.<br>If you are not targeting specific contexts, this field will have no effect on targeting.<br>**Default:** `false` |
| `allow_unknown_player_size` | Boolean | Use this field to target inventory where the player size is unknown. Set this field to `true` when using the fields of the `player_sizes` array to target specific player sizes AND when you want to include inventory for which no player size information has been provided.<br>If you are not targeting specific player sizes, this field will have no effect on targeting.<br>**Default:** `false` |

> [!NOTE]
>
> - When you do NOT set any specific video targeting options, you will target all inventory, including undefined inventory.
> - Ensure that you have elected to include or exclude intro and outro creatives by setting them in the `ad_slot_intro_bumper_action_include` and `ad_slot_outro_bumper_action_include` fields.

### Target a range of query string values

Scenario: Two auto publishers told you to expect `"car year"` data in the query strings of their placements. The first passes the year with the `"car_year"` parameter, and the second passes the year with the `"car_YYYY"` parameter. In order to target this information in your campaign, you added the `"car_year"` parameter to segment 25 and the `"car_YYYY"` parameter to segment 26. Now you want to update the campaign's profile to target placements that include either parameter when the parameter passes any year between `"car_year=2009"` and `"car_year=2012"`, so you create the following JSON and make a `PUT` call to update the profile.

```
$ cat profile_update

$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X PUT -d @profile_update 'https://api.appnexus.com/profile?id=9&advertiser_id=210&member_id=123'

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "count":1,
      "id":9
   }
}
```

### Target a list of query string values

Scenario: An auto publisher told you to expect any of the following key-values in the query strings of their placements: `"car_make=ford"`, `"car_make=honda"`, or `"car_make=toyota"`. In order to target such information, you added the parameter and values to segment 12. Now you want to update the campaign's profile to target those values, so you create the following JSON and make a `PUT` call to update the profile.

```
$ cat profile_update

{
   "profile":{
      "segment_group_targets":[
         {
            "segments":[
               {
                  "id":12,
                  "code":null,
                  "action":"include",
                  "start_minutes":0,
                  "expire_minutes":-1,
                  "other_in_list":[
                     "ford",
                     "honda",
                     "toyota"
                  ]
               }
            ]
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X PUT -d @profile_update 'https://api..com/profile?id=10&advertiser_id=210&member_id=123'

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "count":1,
      "id":10
   }
}
```

### Target an exact query string value

Scenario: An auto publisher told you to expect the following key-values in the query strings of their placements: `car_color=red`,
`car_color=blue`, or `car_color=black`. In order to target such information, you added the parameter and values to segment 15. Now you
want to update the campaign's profile to target a specific query string value, `black`, so you create the following JSON and make a `PUT` call to update the profile.

```
$ cat profile_update

{
   "profile":{
      "segment_group_targets":[
         {
            "segments":[
               {
                  "id":15,
                  "code":null,
                  "action":"include",
                  "start_minutes":0,
                  "expire_minutes":-1,
                  "other_equals":"black"
               }
            ]
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X PUT -d @profile_update 'https://api..com/profile?id=10&advertiser_id=210&member_id=123'

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "count":1,
      "id":10
   }
}
```

### Target specific countries

Scenario: You want to target your profile to the United States and Canada. This requires setting `country_action` to `include` and
`country_targets` to `US` and `CA`, so you create the following JSON and make a `PUT` call to update the profile.

```
$ cat profile_update

{
   "profile":{
      "country_action":"include",
      "country_targets":[
         {
            "id":233
         },
         {
            "id":39
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X PUT -d @profile_update 'https://api..com/profile?id=10&advertiser_id=210&member_id=123'

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "count":1,
      "id":10
   }
}
```

### Target a specific state but exclude a DMA

Scenario: You want to target your profile to the state of New York, excluding the New York City area. This requires setting `region_action` to `include`, `region_targets` to `US:NY`, `dma_action` to `exclude`, and `dma_targets` to `501`, which is the DMA code for New York City. You therefore create the following JSON and make a `PUT` call to update the profile.

```
$ cat profile_update

{
   "profile":{
      "region_action":"include",
      "region_targets":[
         {
            "id":1
         }
      ],
      "dma_action":"exclude",
      "dma_targets":[
         {
            "dma":501
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X PUT -d @profile_update 'https://api..com/profile?id=10&advertiser_id=210&member_id=123'

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "count":1,
      "id":10
   }
}
```

### Target a deal

Scenario: You have negotiated a deal with a seller that grants you access to inventory that is not available to other buyers (i.e., a
private auction). To take advantage of this deal, you need to use the Deal Buyer Access Service to find the deal ID and then update the `deal_targets` array of your profile to target that ID.

1. To find the ID for your deal, you make a `GET` call to the [Deal Buyer Access Service](deal-buyer-access-service.md) and identify the right deal. Alternately, if you know the member ID of the seller, you can pass it in the query string to retrieve only deals you have with that seller, as shown below.

    ```
    $ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/deal-buyer-access?seller_member_id=814'
     
    {
       "response":{
          "status":"OK",
          "count":1,
          "start_element":0,
          "num_elements":100,
          "deals":[
             {
                "id":65,
                "code":null,
                "name":"Private deal for buyer 1085 with floor of 2.5",
                "description":null,
                "active":true,
                "seller_member_id":814,
                "start_date":"2013-12-01 00:00:00",
                "end_date":"2013-12-31 23:59:59",
                "profile_id":null,
                "floor_price":2.5,
                "currency":"USD",
                "use_deal_floor":true,
                "last_modified":"2013-12-04 22:37:49",
                "buyer":{
                   "id":1085,
                   "bidder_id":2
                },
                "type":{
                   "id":2,
                   "name":"Private Auction"
                },
                "brands":[
                   {
                      "id":1
                   }
                ]
             }
          ]
       }
    }
    ```

1. You then create the JSON file with `deal_targets` set to the ID of the deal.

    ```
    $ cat profile_update

    {
       "profile":{
          "deal_targets":[
             {
                "id":65
             }
          ]
       }
    }
    ```

1. Finally, you make a `PUT` call to update the profile.

    ```
    $ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X PUT -d @profile_update 'https://api.appnexus.com/profile?id=22&advertiser_id=210&member_id=123'

    {
       "response":{
          "status":"OK",
          "count":1,
          "id":22
       }
    }
    ```

### Use OS family targets and OS extended targets together

The OS extended and OS family targets work in tandem to allow different targeting scenarios for specific operating system families. This
functionality is best represented by usage examples. This section contains the following examples (scroll down or search to view them).

- Target iOS 7.0 devices; all other OS families and other iOS versions will not serve.
- Target all iOS devices regardless of version; all other OS families will not serve.
- Target all OSes that are not Unknown, Linux, or Symbian.
- Target all Android devices, along with iOS 7.0.
- Target all Android and all iOS and all Windows Mobile.
- Target Mac OS 10.8 (Mountain Lion) and MS Windows 8.0.
- Target Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) and all Windows Desktop except XP and 2000.
- Target all iOS operating systems except 2.0 and 2.1.
- Invalid configuration: Cannot include an OS family and exclude its members.
- Invalid configuration: Cannot include and exclude members of the same OS family.
- Invalid configuration: Cannot include members of an excluded OS family.

### Target iOS 7.0 devices; all other OS families and other iOS versions will not serve

```
{
   "profile":{
      "operating_system_family_action":"include",
      "operating_system_family_targets":{
         
      },
      "operating_system_extended_targets":{
         "id":80,
         "name":"iOS 7.0",
         "action":"include"
      }
   }
}            
            
```

### Target all iOS devices regardless of version; all other OS families will not serve

```

   },
   "operating_system_extended_targets":{
      
   }
}            
            
```

### Target all OS that are not Unknown, Linux, or Symbian

In other words, serve on any Android, iOS, MacOS, Windows, Blackberry, or Windows Mobile device.

```
{
   "profile":{
      "operating_system_family_action":"exclude",
      "operating_system_family_targets":[
         {
            "id":0,
            "name":"Unknown"
         },
         {
            "id":8,
            "name":"Linux"
         },
         {
            "id":9,
            "name":"Symbian OS"
         }
      ]
   }
}            
            
```

### Target all Android devices, along with iOS 7.0

All other iOS versions will not serve, and all non-Android devices will not serve.

```
{
   "profile":{
      "operating_system_family_action":"include",
      "operating_system_family_targets":{
         "id":2,
         "name":"Android"
      }
   },
   "operating_system_extended_targets":[
      {
         "id":80,
         "name":"iOS 7.0",
         "action":"include"
      }
   ]
}            
            
```

### Target all Android and all iOS and all Windows mobile

```
{
   "profile":{
      "operating_system_family_action":"include",
      "operating_system_family_targets":[
         {
            "id":2,
            "name":"Android"
         },
         {
            "id":3,
            "name":"Apple iOS"
         },
         {
            "id":7,
            "name":"Microsoft Mobile"
         }
      ],
      "operating_system_extended_targets":{
         
      }
   }
}            
            
```

### Target Mac OS 10.8 (Mountain Lion) and MS Windows 8.0

This example combines OS Extended Targets from different OS families.

```
{
   "profile":{
      "operating_system_family_action":"include",
      "operating_system_family_targets":{
         
      },
      "operating_system_extended_targets":[
         {
            "id":81,
            "name":"10.8 Mountain Lion",
            "action":"include"
         },
         {
            "id":93,
            "name":"Windows 8",
            "action":"include"
         }

```

### Target Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) and all Windows Desktop except XP and 2000

```
{
   "profile":{
      "operating_system_family_action":"include",
      "operating_system_family_targets":{
         
      },
      "operating_system_extended_targets":[
         {
            "id":80,
            "name":"10.8 Mountain Lion",
            "action":"include"
         },
         {
            "id":89,
            "name":"Windows 2000",
            "action":"exclude"
         },
         {
            "id":90,
            "name":"Windows XP",
            "action":"exclude"
         }
      ]
   }
}            
            
```

### Target all iOS operating systems except 2.0 and 2.1

```
{
   "profile":{
      "operating_system_family_action":"include",
      "operating_system_family_targets":[
         {
            "id":3,
            "name":"Apple iOS"
         }
      ],
      "operating_system_extended_targets":[
         {
            "id":47,
            "action":"include",
            "name":"iOS 2.0"
         },
         {
            "id":48,
            "action":"include",
            "name":"iOS 2.1"
         }
      ]
   }
}            
            
```

The following profile targeting configurations are invalid and may result in unexpected behavior.

### Invalid configuration: Cannot include an OS family and exclude its members

```
{
   "profile":{
      "operating_system_family_action":"include",
      "operating_system_family_targets":[
         {
            "id":3,
            "name":"Apple iOS"
         }
      ],
      "operating_system_extended_targets":[
         {
            "id":47,
            "action":"include",
            "name":"iOS 2.0"
         },
         {
            "id":48,
            "action":"include",
            "name":"iOS 2.1"
         }
      ]
   }
}            
            
```

### Invalid configuration: Cannot include and exclude members of the same OS family

            "name":"iOS 2.0",
            "action":"include"
         },
         {
            "id":48,
            "name":"iOS 2.1",
            "action":"exclude"
         }
      ]
   }
}            
            
```

### Invalid configuration: Cannot include members of an excluded OS family

```
{
   "profile":{

         }
      ]
   }
}            
            
```

### Target ad pod positions

#### Target specific ad slot positions (last, first, third)

```
{
   "profile":{
      "ad_slot_intro_bumper_action_include":false,
      "ad_slot_outro_bumper_action_include":false,
      "ad_slot_position_action_include":true,
      "ad_slot_position_targets":[
         -1,
         0,
         2
      ]
   }
}            
            
```

#### Target only bumper positions (intro and outro)

```
{
   "profile":{
      "ad_slot_position_action_include":true,
      "ad_slot_position_targets":[],
      "ad_slot_intro_bumper_action_include":true,
      "ad_slot_outro_bumper_action_include":true
   }
}            
            
```

#### Target any ad pod slot

```
{
   "profile":{
      "ad_slot_position_action_include":false,
      "ad_slot_position_targets":[],
      "ad_slot_intro_bumper_action_include":false,
      "ad_slot_outro_bumper_action_include":false
   }
}            
            
```

#### Exclude all ad pod slots and bumpers

This behavior is not something you will want to replicate; you will not serve on anything.

```
{
   "profile":{
      "ad_slot_position_action_include":true,
      "ad_slot_position_targets":[],
      "ad_slot_intro_bumper_action_include":false,
      "ad_slot_outro_bumper_action_include":false
   }
}            
            
```

#### Target only the intro bumper

```
{
   "profile":{
      "ad_slot_position_action_include":true,
      "ad_slot_position_targets":[],
      "ad_slot_intro_bumper_action_include":true,

The following profile targeting configurations are invalid and may result in unexpected behavior.

#### Invalid configuration: Cannot target all ad slots and all bumper positions

```
{
   "profile":{
      "ad_slot_position_action_include":false,
      "ad_slot_position_targets":[],
      "ad_slot_intro_bumper_action_include":true,
      "ad_slot_outro_bumper_action_include":true
   }
}

### Target a Programmatic Guaranteed deal

Scenario: You have negotiated a Programmatic Guaranteed deal (PG deal) with a seller and would like to target this deal with a PG buying line item. You'll need to create a PG deal profile using the PG deal ID. You then must associate this profile with a PG buying line item to target the deal (see the Create a PG buying line item example in [Line Item ALI Service](line-item-service---ali.md)).

1. Create a PG deal profile JSON that includes the deal target ID.
    > [!NOTE]
    > For PG buying line items, you can only have one deal target in the `deal_targets` array.

    ```
    $ cat pg_deal_profile

    {
       "profile":{
          "deal_targets":[
             {
                "id":456
             }
          ],
          "allow_unaudited":true
       }
    }
    ```

1. Make a `POST` request to the `https://api.appnexus.com/profile` endpoint with this PG deal profile JSON and an appropriate `advertiser_id`.

    ```
    $ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @pg_deal_profile 'https://api.appnexus.com/profile?advertiser_id=123'
     
    {
       "response":{
