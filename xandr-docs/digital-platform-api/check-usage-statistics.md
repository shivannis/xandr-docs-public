# Digital Platform API - Check usage statistics

## REST API call

When making a call to the API to retrieve statistics, the following fields can be set in the query string:

- `agg` can be omitted in order to obtain an hourly/detailed report.
- `agg=true` can be used to obtain an aggregated report.
- `start` date should be set in the following format: `2015-11-01+01:00:00`.
- `end` date should be set in the following format: `2015-12-01+01:00:00`.

```
curl -H "Authorization: hbapi:123456:9876abcd54321:nym2"-XGET"https://streaming-data.appnexus.com/rt-segment-processed?member_id=100&start=2014-05-22+00:00:00&end=2014-05-22+01:00:00"
```

The statistics are deduplicated per request made to the service. For example, if the same user is added to the same segment in three
different requests, `num_valid_adds` and `num_valid_users` would show "3". When using `agg=true`, there will be one entry in the report
property of the response. It will be an aggregation of all usage statistics in the date range that's specified. `error_log_lines` and
`segment_log_lines` will be empty, and the processed hour will be for the last hour in the date range that's specified. However, if no date range is specified, the report will show the data from the last two weeks.

### Example: Aggregated Usage report

```
{
    "response": {
        "report": {
            "error_log_lines": null,
            "match_rate": 87.7,
            "member_id": 123,
            "num_inactive_segments": 0,
            "num_invalid_segments": 0,
            "num_invalid_users": 25,

            "segment_log_lines": null
        },

    }
