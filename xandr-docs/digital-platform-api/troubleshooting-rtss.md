## Bulk upload status

If you're unsure whether your bulk upload succeeded, you can query the upload ID returned when the bulk upload job was created. Querying the upload ID returns a report of how many rows succeeded and failed during the upload, as well as the first 100 errors in the file.

For example, to check the status for upload ID `a04d88c3-8cc7-11e6-868d-7cd30ab7f6e2` uploaded by member 123, run the following cURL command:

```
curl -b cookies https://api.appnexus.com/apd-api/members/123/uploads?id=a04d88c3-8cc7-11e6-868d-7cd30ab7f6e2
```

The following table shows the possible status returned for the upload overall.

| Status | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `SUBMITTED_1` | The file has been submitted and queued for processing. |
| `PROCESSING_2` | The file is being processed. |
| `COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS_4` | The file was processed, and most targets have been uploaded properly. However, some lines generated errors, such as negative TTL or a segment access problem, that may have led to problems uploading specific targets. To investigate, check the `message` field in the API response. |
| `COMPLETED_3` | The file was successfully processed, and the resulting targets have been uploaded to the RTSS segments without significant errors. |
| `FAILED_5` | The uploaded file had a significant number of serious errors, and your targets couldn't be uploaded. To investigate, check the `message` field in the API response. After you've fixed the error, try re-uploading the file. |

## Campaigns buying against deactivated targets

Targets that have been uploaded to RTSS with `seg_ttl` values in the future could take a few hours to expire from the RTSS cache after an
update is sent to the system. In this case, your segments may continue being added to impressions after you have updated your targeting
parameters. This will continue until those targets have expired.
