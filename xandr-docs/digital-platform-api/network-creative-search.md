## Example

1. **Create a JSON-formatted report request**

    The JSON file should include the `report_type` `"network_creative_search"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`month`, `day`), and specify the format in which the data should be returned (`csv`, `excel`, or `html`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md).

    ```
    $ cat network_creative_search
    {
            "report":
            {
                    "report_type":"network_creative_search",
                    "columns":[
                            "day",
                            "seller_member_id",
                            "buyer_member_id",
                            "publisher_id",
                            "creative_id",
                            "brand_id",
                            "media_subtype_id",
                            "imps"
                    ],
                    "report_interval":"today",
                    "format":"csv"
            }
    }
    ```

1. **`POST` the request to the reporting service**

    ```
    $ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @network_creative_search 'https://api.appnexus.com/report'
    {
       "response":{
          "status":"OK",
          "report_id":"9b52ff138e5f9c822bdd8eee4119acf2"
       }
    }
    ```

1. **`GET` the report status from the report service**

    Make a `GET` call with the Report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is "ready". Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

    ```
    $ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=9b52ff138e5f9c822bdd8eee4119acf2'
    {
       "response":{
          "status":"OK",
          "report":{
             "name":null,
             "created_on": "2013-03-19 18:42:33",
             "json_request": "{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"network_creative_search\",\"columns\" [\"day\",\"seller_member_id\",\"buyer_member_id\",\"publisher_id\",\"creative_id\",
             \"brand_id\",\"media_subtype_id\",\"imps\"],\"report_interval\":\"today\",\"format\":\"csv\",\"filters\":[{\"seller_member_id\":\"1066\"}]}}",
             "url": "report-download?id=9b52ff138e5f9c822bdd8eee4119acf2"
          },
          "execution_status":"ready"
       }
    }
    ```

1. **`GET` the report data from the Report Download Service**

    To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the Report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and Report ID in the `url` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use -i or -v in your call to expose the response header.

    ```
    $ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=9b52ff138e5f9c822bdd8eee4119acf2' > /tmp/network_creative.csv
    ```
