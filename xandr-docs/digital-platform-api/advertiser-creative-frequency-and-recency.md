# Advertiser creative frequency and recency

The Advertiser Creative Frequency & Recency report can be used to view creative data for a specific advertiser based on the frequency and recency of user views. This report is available to advertiser and network users.

For instructions on retrieving a report, please see [Report Service](./report-service.md) or see the [example](#example) below. For an advertiser user, the advertiser ID is detected based on the user's authentication. For a network user, however, this report requires specifying the advertiser ID as part of the URL, for example:

```
https://api.appnexus.com/report?advertiser_id=ADVERTISER_ID
```
