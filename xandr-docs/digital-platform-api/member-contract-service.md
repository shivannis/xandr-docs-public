# Member contract service

> [!NOTE]
> This service is currently available to a limited set of clients and Microsoft employees only.

There are two types of pricing terms denoted by the `pricing_version` field.

- `"2007.09.01"`: These are the "legacy" pricing terms.
- `"2013.01.02"`: These are the newer pricing terms. Most client contracts negotiated post-2013 will use these new pricing terms. The upshot of the new pricing terms are that clients pay a buy-side fee for both partner and platform inventory, and that clients pay a different seller revshare for buyers on the Xandr platform than for bidder buyers.

> [!NOTE]
> This service is available only to Xandr admin users who have the `is_sales_ops` field set to true. Note that the `is_sales_ops` field can be set to true only via a direct database update. Valid reasons to have your `is_sales_ops` field set in production include:
> 
> - You are a member of the Sales Ops team, and it is your regular job to create and update contracts.
> - You are an engineer, product manager, or test engineer who needs access to create or update contracts for your job.
> - You want to see Katharine, Jennifer Yang, and Alison cry. (Yes, really.)
> - If you are in Services and need to create or update contracts in sand, you should request a direct DB write for your sand user but please understand that you won't have the same capability in production.

> [!WARNING]
> On a `PUT` call, if you include only specific contracts, the contracts not included will be **deleted**. Therefore it is best to include all contracts on `PUT`.
> [!NOTE]
> Updating and deleting contracts
>
> - The Sales Op can only update the following fields for contracts in progress: `notes` and `end_date`. For past contracts, she can only update the `notes`. For future contracts she can update all the fields.
> - Note that if you clone a contract whose `pricing_type` is `"2007.09.01"`, update `pricing_type` to `"2013.01.02"`, and then update it once more to `"2007.09.01"`, any minimums will be set to zero.
> - The Sales Op can only delete contracts which are in the future.

## JSON fields

There is a large intersection between the sets of required fields depending on whether the `pricing_version` is `"2007.09.01"` (marked below as `OLD`) or `"2013.01.02"` (marked below as `NEW`); only those fields that differ between pricing versions are marked as such in the **Old or New?** column.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `id` | int | The ID of the contract.<br><br>**Requird On**: `PUT`/`DELETE`, in query string. |
| `member_id` | int | The ID of the member to which the contract applies. |
| `last_activity` | timestamp | The date of the last modification of this contract "object". |
| `start_date` | datetime | The date and time when the terms of the contract start. New contracts should begin in the future, and typically on the first day of a month.<br><br>**Requird On**: `POST` |
| `end_date` | datetime | The date and time when the terms of the contract end. This should always come at the end of a month.<br><br>**Requird On**: `POST` |
| `auction_revshare` | float | This field is not used. |

| `ad_serving_cpm` | float | The managed ad serving fee charged on kept impressions (to include: kept, default, PSA). This does not represent a seller ad serving fee CPM, which is not yet implemented in the system. |
| `auditing_fee_per_creative` | float | The per-creative auditing fee. |
| `creative_size_minimum_bytes` | int | The size above which a creative is considered over-sized. The member is charged a creative overage fee (based on the value in `creative_size_fee_per_gb`) for serving an oversized creative. |
| `creative_size_fee_per_gb` | float | The fee that is charged per gigabyte for a creative that exceeds the `creative_size_minimum_bytes`. |
| `monthly_minimum_spend` | float | This field is mislabeled. The monthly minimum fees the member commits to paying per month.<br><br>**Old or New**: `OLD` |
| `clearing_revshare` | float | The flat fee taken out of clearing revenues by Xandr. Members may choose to be billed as a percentage instead (see `clearing_revshare_pct` below). |

PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS FIELD UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.<br><br>**Old or New**: `OLD`<br>**Default**: `"0.00"` |
| `clearing_revshare_pct` | float | The clearing deduction percentage. This is charged when the member buys from an external or partner seller. |
| `auction_maximum_cpm` | float | The maximum amount the buyer agrees to pay on a per-impression basis. For this reason, the sum of client's auction service fees and deductions may not be equal to their total media cost multiplied by their auction revshare at the end of the month. |
| `apply_min_cpm_to_clearing` | boolean | This field is not used.<br><br>**Default**: `False` |
| `auction_revshare_type` | enum | The type of buyer auction revenue share.

PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS FIELD UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.<br><br>**Default**: - `"fee"`<br>**Old or New**: `OLD` |

With the 2013 pricing terms, clients pay a buy-side fee for both partner and platform inventory, and clients pay a different seller revshare for Xandr platform buyers than for bidder buyers.

| `note` | string | An optional note. |
| `data_siphon_fee` | int | The monthly charge for receiving Xandr [log-level data feeds](../log-level-data/log-level-data-feeds.md). |

| `direct_clear_fee_pct` | float | The direct clear fee percentage. This is used for activity where the member clears the cost of media directly with the seller. |
| `contract_type` | enum | This field is no longer used. In the past, it was used by the finance team for revenue reporting.
