# Deal buyer setting service

The Deal Buyer Setting Service lets buyers give deals an internal alias for clarity in the UI and assign a status to deals so buyers have more control over which deals they’re targeting. Note that these deal settings are only available to the buyers who created them and are not visible to the seller of the deal.

> [!NOTE]
> Buyers can use the [Deal Buyer Access Saervice](./deal-buyer-access-service.md) to view the deals available to them and the `deal_targets`field in the [Profile Service](./profile-service.md) to target them. Sellers can use the [Deal Service](./deal-service.md) to set up and manage deals.

## Examples

### Add deal setting

If a deal-buyer-setting object has already been created for the deal, the POST request will return the following error message: "`The buyer_member_id, deal_id combination was not unique.`" To modify this deal-buyer-setting, first make a `GET` [https://api.appnexus.com/deal-buyer-setting?deal_id=DEAL_ID](https://api.appnexus.com/deal-buyer-setting?deal_id=DEAL_ID) request to return the deal-buyer-setting ID. Then use the deal-buyer-setting ID with a `PUT` [https://api.appnexus.com/deal-buyer-setting?id=ID](https://api.appnexus.com/deal-buyer-setting?id=ID) request to modify the deal-buyer-setting.
