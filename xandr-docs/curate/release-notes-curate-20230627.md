# Microsoft Curate - June 27, 2023: New advertiser and insertion order screens in the Microsoft Curate UI

With new screens accessible from the `Package` menu, curators can now manage and keep an eye on their advertisers and insertion orders more easily.

Additionally, new analytics enable you to quickly track deliveries.
