1. In the **Sign in** page, enter Email ID associated with your Microsoft Advertising account login and click **Next**. If you have registered a different email ID for Microsoft products, ensure that the Microsoft Advertising platform account matches the email used to log in to Microsoft. If they do not match, contact the designated person with the role of **User Manager** from your organization to do the needful or you can raise a ticket on the [Microsoft Advertising Customer Support Portal](https://help.xandr.com/s/login/).

1. If your organization requires IT Admin approval to use the **Sign in with Microsoft** method to log into Microsoft Curate, then follow up with your organization's IT team.

1. If your organization has implemented Multi Factor Authention (MFA) process, you will be presented with MFA challenge. Use the [Microsoft Authenticator App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/security/mobile-authenticator-app) to do the needful and enter the One-time password code displayed in the app to login to your account.

1. Post successful authentication, you will be directed to the landing page of Microsoft Curate. This marks the succesful completion of the migration process. Going forward, when you log in to the application, you will be directed to sign in with Microsoft Identity Platform.
