# Curator reporting

Once you've started selling [Curated Deals](curated-deals.md), you can run reports to analyze how your curated deals are performing. To understand our reports and the use cases they're intended for, see the [Reporting Guide](reporting-guide.md).

The following curator reports are available:

- [Curator Analytics Report](curator-analytics-report.md) - Provides curators insight into how money is flowing from demand to supply within their curated marketplace.
- [Curator Bid Error Report](curator-bid-error-report.md) - Provides curators insight into rejected demand through a randomly selected set of 1% of the errors logged on the Microsoft Advertising platform.
- [Curator Billing Report](curator-billing-report.md) - Provides curators insight into internal invoicing for their curation activities.
- [Curator Segment Performance Report](curator-segment-performance-report.md) - Provides curators insight into how their targeted segments are contributing to the overall performance of their curated deals.
