# Microsoft Curate - Introduction to viewability

This page provides an overview of viewability in digital media as well
as information about why viewability is important, how it works, and
current Microsoft Advertising support for viewability.

## What is viewability and why is it important?

Marketers buy media to reach "eyeballs" in an effort to create awareness
for their brand and influence consumers. If a marketer's advertisement
goes unseen, there is no opportunity for the message to have an impact.
An ad being seen by a human is therefore a fundamental requirement for
all advertising. Digital media presents a unique and exciting
opportunity to directly measure whether an ad was in-view of a consumer.

Today, viewability is commonly used to assess the quality and value of
digital media, and it is often included as a mandatory goal in
advertisers' campaigns.

## Buy-Side impact

Viewability is useful to the buy side because it allows buyers to select
websites that provide good quality exposure. Branding campaigns can
focus on viewability as a key performance indicator. Maximizing ad
viewability is a goal for the media buyer.

Additionally, viewability can be used to boost the performance of direct
response ad campaigns. When evaluated in the light of direct response,
viewability can be utilized as a metric to select quality sites where
ads are in-view increasing the chance for potential conversions.

Viewability could also allow buyers to use new attribution models for
post-view conversions.

## Sell-Side impact

Because more and more buyers value media based on viewability metrics,
publishers have incentive to be aware of how viewable their sites are.
Understanding and managing viewability for inventory presents the
opportunity to create high viewability packages and improve overall
inventory quality.

## How does viewability measurement work for Display Ads?

Viewability measurement is the technological answer to a longer-lasting
business need. In order for a creative to be viewable, all the following
conditions must be met:

- The browser window must be in the focus.
- More than 50% of the area of the creative (30% of the area for large
  size creatives) must be in the viewable part of the screen. This takes
  into account the size of the screen, the size and position of the
  creative on the page, and any scrolling action by the user.
- For large Ads, the creative size (including video creatives) is
  242,500 pixels minimum.

The following are examples of creatives that are not viewable:

Viewability depends on a myriad of parameters: screen size, creative
loading duration, and so on.

Viewability measurement is achieved through a technology that is
embedded with the creative, executes in the browser of the user, and
measures the actual behavior of each individual user who is served the
creative.

Viewability measurement is, by its nature, an exhaustive measurement of
every single impression.

## Technical summary

Viewability measurement is achieved by JavaScript embedded within the
creative. This script is called for each individual ad-impression. It
launches automatically as the page loads, and immediately starts
measuring if and when the creative is viewable.

The primary method that the script will use to determine whether an ad
is viewable is "page geometry", which takes into account the size of the
screen and the size and position of the creative on the page among other
factors such as scrolling and window focus. However, if only a part of
the required information is available, other techniques must be used so
that the measurement is consistent across all platforms.

## Technical challenges

Viewability measurement must work in all environments and provide
consistent results. IFrames are the most challenging of technical
environments. When the creative and the measurement script are served
within an IFrame, regular geometric methods cannot be applied.
Alternative methods, such as browser optimization, must be developed.
Depending on the technologies used by ad-viewability vendors, the
potential success rate can be very limited.

In some instances, viewability cannot be measured with success. In these
cases, no assumption can be made on the viewability of the impression.

## Using viewability data

Several aggregations are feasible from impression-level viewability
data. The most common metrics include:

- Number of viewable impressions
- Viewability rate
- Measurement success rate

It is possible to use these metrics to gain insight into the comparative
quality of various media. A buyer can compare the viewability rate of
one ad campaign to:

- Industry benchmarks
- Internal benchmarks
- Other advertisers in a portfolio
- Other campaigns for the same advertiser

It is also possible for a media buyer to:

- Generate reports that provide viewability data broken down by domains
  or line items, allowing for comparison of different inventory sources.
- Choose to exclude (blocklist), or include (allowlist), a selection of
  domains or line items, enabling control over the viewability of
  inventory purchased.

## Measurement technology

Viewability measurement on Microsoft Advertising is tested continuously across all major
browser versions, including web, mobile app, and mobile web context.
