# About Microsoft Curate

Microsoft Curate lets curators use their proprietary assets to enhance the value of a seller’s inventory and create unique offerings for buyers.

## Benefits

Curators such as retailers, data companies, independent trading desks, and other media companies can use audience data, preferred  inventory access, specially negotiated rates with sellers, optimization capabilities, investment strategy, and other assets to provide curated deals to buyers.

For buyers who execute a large volume of campaigns and need to manage their media investment, Microsoft Curate offers a single platform to easily centralize their business rules and targeting configurations across DSPs to simplify campaign execution. Using Microsoft Curate, buyers can act as curators to create deals that reflect their decisions about segments, supply types, inventory lists, margin percentage, optimization, and so on.

Curated deals can be bought via Microsoft Invest and all major DSPs.
