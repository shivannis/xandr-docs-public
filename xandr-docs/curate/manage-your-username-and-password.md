# Microsoft Curate - Manage your username and password

This page explains how to manage your username and password in Microsoft Curate. It covers the following issues:

- Logging in after being locked out because of multiple failed login attempts.
- Retrieving your username if you've forgotten it.
- Resetting your password if you've forgotten it or if it's expired and you need a new one.

## Logging in after being locked out

If you've entered the incorrect username or password three times, you will be locked out from Curate. The lockout will last for a period of **five minutes**. You can attempt to log in again after waiting five minutes.

## Retrieving your username

If you cannot sign in to Microsoft Curate due to a forgotten username, follow these steps:

1. Go to the login page of Microsoft Advertising Curate and click **Reset Password**.

1. On the **Reset Password** screen, click **Forgot Username**?

1. Enter your email address and click **Send Email**.

    Within a few minutes, you'll receive an email including all of the usernames associated with the email address you entered. Each username is listed with its status so that you can more easily identify your current username.

    If you don't see the email in your inbox, be sure to check your spam folder. If you still don't see it, the email address you entered might not be valid. Try again and submit a support request at [Customer Care](https://help.xandr.com/s/login/) if you continue to have problems.

## Resetting your password

Microsoft Curate passwords must be changed at least once every 120 days. After 120 days, the password will no longer be valid and you will be prompted to create a new one.

    - At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
    - At least one digit (0-9)
    - At least one special character (such as \#, $, ? %, &)
1. Retype the password to confirm it and click **Submit**.
