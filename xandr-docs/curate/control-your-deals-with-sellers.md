# Microsoft Curate - Control your deals with sellers

You can control deals received from sellers on the **Deals** screen. You can:

- Set deal review preferences to require a review or allow any new deals received from a seller to be set to Active status automatically.
- Accept or decline deals upon review 9.
- Manage the status of deals at any time by accepting, deactivating, or declining them.
- Assign a deal alias (internal name) to any seller deal for easier management within your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on managing deals with sellers including viewing basic and advanced deal metrics, monitoring each deal's health, and running detailed reports, see [Manage Your Deals with Sellers](manage-your-deals-with-sellers.md).

## Getting to the Deals screen

To reach the **Deals with Sellers** screen, select **Inventory > Seller Deals**.

## Setting deal review preferences

Buyers can configure the default manner in which they process new seller deals by selecting one of the following settings:

- **Default Active**: new seller deals will be set to **Active** status by default when received. Deals can be declined or changed to **Inactive** status later if necessary (see [Managing Deal Status](control-your-deals-with-sellers.md#managing-deal-status)).
  
- **Require Review**: new seller deals will be set to **Pending** status by default when received until the deals are reviewed by the buyer and accepted or declined (see [Accepting or Declining Deals](control-your-deals-with-sellers.md#accepting-or-declining-deals)).

 > [!NOTE]
  >
  > - **Default Active** is the default setting if no deal review preference is set.
  > - Changing the review preference only affects new deals. It does not change the status of existing deals.

To set the deal review preference for new seller deals, do the following:

1. Select **Inventory > Seller Deals**.
1. On the top right of the **Deals** screen, click the edit icon on **New Deals Do Not Require Approval** (or **New Deals Require Approval** if it’s been changed previously) to open **Review Preferences**.
1. On the **Review Preferences** page, select either:
   - **Default Active** – to accept all new deals and set their status to **Active**
   - **Require Review** – to require review of all new deals before accepting or declining them
1. Click **Save**.

## Accepting or declining deals

If you have set your buyer review preference to **Require Review** (see [Setting Deal Review Preferences](control-your-deals-with-sellers.md#setting-deal-review-preferences)), you can then review new deals and accept or decline them. You can also accept or decline deals that are in any status (i.e., **Pending**, **Active**, **Inactive**, or **Declined**). Accepting deals changes the deal status to **Active** and declining deals changes the deal status to **Declined**.

## Accepted deals

When you select **Accept**, the deal is:

- Added to your list of **Active** deals
- Eligible for targeting
- Passed to the bidstream

> [!NOTE]
> Accepted deals can be set to **Inactive** status (see [Managing Deal Status](control-your-deals-with-sellers.md))
> if you want to remove them from the list of **Active** deals.

## Declined deals

When you select **Decline**, the deal is:

- Added to your list of **Declined** deals
- Not eligible for targeting
- Not passed to the bidstream

> [!NOTE]
> You can change **Declined** deals to **Active** at any time (see [Managing Deal Status](control-your-deals-with-sellers.md#managing-deal-status)).

To accept or decline one or more new deals:

1. Select **Inventory > Seller Deals**.
1. Check the box next to any deals you want to accept or decline (you can search by **Deal Name**, **Deal Alias**, **Deal ID**, or **Code**).
1. In the **Select** drop-down, select **Accept** or **Decline**.

## Managing deal status

You can manage the status of deals so you can control when each deal is available for targeting. A deal can have a status of **Pending**, **Active**, **Declined**, or **Inactive**.
The following table provides a description of each status, when the status occurs, and available actions you can perform given the status of the deal:

| Buyer Deal Status | Description | Status Occurs When: | Available Actions |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pending** | Deal not passed in bidstream<br>Not available for targeting<br>Not included in **Target All Deals** | **Review Preferences** set to **Require Review**. | **Accept** or **Decline** deal. |
| **Active** | Deal passed in bidstream<br>Available for targeting, and included in **Target All Deals**. | **Review Preferences** set to **Default Active**.<br>**Pending** deal is accepted.<br>**Inactive** or **Declined** deal set to **Active**. | Set status to **Inactive** or **Declined** |
| **Declined** | Deal not passed in bidstream<br>Not available for targeting<br>Not included in **Target All Deals** | **Pending** deal is declined.<br>**Active** deal set to **Declined** | Set status to **Active** or **Inactive** |
| **Inactive** | Deal not passed in bidstream<br>Not available for targeting<br>Not included in **Target All Deals** | **Active** deal set to **Inactive**. | Set status to **Active** or **Declined**. |

## Change deal status

To change the status of deals you receive from sellers to **Active**, **Inactive**, or **Declined**, do the
following:

- When you set a deal to **Active** status, it will only be active if the seller has activated the deal.
- You cannot change the status of a deal to **Pending**. This status is only set if a new deal is received when **Review Preferences** is set to **Require Review**.

1. Select **Inventory > Seller Deals**.
1. Click anywhere in the row of the deal you want to change the status of (you can search by **Deal Name**, **Deal Alias**, **Deal ID**, or **Code** to find a specific deal).
1. In the **Deal Controls** section, click the edit icon and select a status from the **Acceptance Status** drop-down.
1. Click **Save**.

## Setting groups of deals to active or declined status

While you can change the status of each deal to **Active** or **Declined** using the **Deal Controls** of each deal, you can only make these changes one deal at a time. If you have a group of deals that you’d like to set to **Active** or **Declined** status, you can check the box next to these deals and click **Accept** in the Select drop-down to set them to **Active** status, or **Decline** to set them to
**Declined** status [Accepting or Declining Deals](control-your-deals-with-sellers.md#accepting-or-declining-deals).

## Assigning a deal alias

You can assign a **Deal Alias** to use as a buyer internal name for seller deals so you can manage these deals by a name you provide for it. The alias you assign to a deal appears in the **Deal Alias** column of the **Deals with Sellers** page along with the **Deal Name** that the seller provided for the deal.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Deal Alias** you assign to a deal is not viewable by the seller of the deal.

To assign a **Deal Alias** to a deal, do the following:

> [!NOTE]
> The **Deal Alias** field is limited to 254 characters.

1. Select **Inventory > Seller Deals**.
1. Click anywhere in the row of the deal you want to assign a **Deal Alias** to (you can search by **Deal Name**, **Deal Alias**, **Deal ID**, or **Code** to find a specific deal).
1. In the **Deal Controls** section, click the edit icon and enter the internal name in the **Deal Alias** field.
1. Click **Save**.
