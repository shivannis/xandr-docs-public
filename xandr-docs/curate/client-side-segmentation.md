# Microsoft Curate - Client-side segmentation

The most common way of building audience segments is by placing client-side segment pixels on websites or creatives, signaling that a user has visited a web page or taken a simple action. If you're new to audience targeting or if you have relatively simple audience targeting strategies, then this method is probably the one that you'll want to use.

## Use cases

- **Performance / retargeting campaigns** - As users browse the Internet, they visit sites that move them along the attribution funnel (or a series of interactions that elicit a desired action from the user,  such as a page visit, conversion, etc.) You, as a buyer, might set up several ad campaigns each targeting a particular segment that corresponds to a section of the attribution funnel. Users are added to these segments as they visit different pages relevant to the acquisition event (such as visiting the home page, adding items to a shopping cart page, a purchase confirmation page, etc.)
- **Brand awareness campaigns** - If you're a buyer or seller, and are looking to do basic clustering or modeling of audiences, you can also use client-side segment pixels. In this instance, the purpose would be for branding, ultimately giving a signal that a user has visited a particular page or taken a specific action. While similar to the retargeting example above, in this situation, the goal is to bring brand awareness to the relevant audience rather than prompting a user response or action. An example of this is a "luxury car enthusiast" client-side segment pixel firing on a high end online magazine, where the audience would then be bought against by trading desks representing the branding efforts for BMW.
