**Legacy ads SDK creative specs**

Legacy SDK (versions prior to Windows 10) currently represents 55% of total impressions on the Windows 3rd Party AppNetwork (Windows 7 has 35% of total traffic, Windows 8.1 10% etc.). This percentage is steadily decreasing as Windows 10 adoption continues.

Any legacy SDK before Windows 8.1 lacks support for mobile standard third-party ad serving, impression tracking pixels, javascript and MRAID.

As an Microsoft Advertising Buyer, you may still access legacy
SDK inventory by uploading an image creative to
Microsoft Advertising and specifying a landing page. For more
information on uploading a hosted image as a creative, see

## Best practice for reach

To maximize reach across Windows App inventory, we recommend targeting both Supply Type "Mobile App" and “Web” inventory within Microsoft Advertising Exchange without additional parameters such as "Device Type." This is because there are certain instances where Microsoft Advertising does not receive this information from the device SDK and applications are presented as Sites referencing the Windows Store URL.

## Packages and deals

Packages are a great way to leverage Microsoft user data with your campaigns. Currently, Windows AppNetwork and Windows Phone AppNetwork offer a few packages broken out by content category such as entertainment, games, and news. See [Buying
Microsoft Deals](buying-microsoft-deals.md) for more.

## Extra information

**User identification (Microsoft Ad ID)**

All Microsoft Windows App inventory includes a mobile-specific device identifier called the Windows Ad ID. This identifier is similar to other mobile app identifiers like IDFA or Google Play in that it is persistent across apps on the same device, compliant to the user's OS-level privacy settings.

For Windows 10 inventory, Microsoft also provides the Microsoft Advertising ID (UUID64) corresponding to the user's
default browser where available. This process is called user-syncing, and enables advertisers to track users across devices. **User-sync is available on 82% of Windows 10 impressions, and better enables category targeting, frequency cap, conversion tracking and more.**

**App-Install Attribution (Window Store ID)**

For buyers running campaigns with a CPA goal of an App installation, the third-party app installation vendors Tune, Adjust, and Kochava support Windows Apps attribution tracking through Microsoft Advertising. If you are using a third-party ad server, you will be tracking conversions in that third-party ad server, which will require its own integration with Tune, Adjust, or Kochava for conversion attribution. We will continue onboarding additional attribution vendors. If you rely upon a specific attribution vendor that is not supported today, please contact your Microsoft Advertising Account Representative.
