# Product and inventory service

## Overview

The Yield Analytics Product and Inventory API exposes functionality for discovery of products from within the Yield Analytics environment and retrieval of product inventory and consumption data. When interacting with product related API functionality developers should understand that products may be either static or dynamic. These two types of products differ in the following ways:

- Static products exist in the Yield Analytics system when they have been imported in relation to order lines flowing into the Yield Analytics system, or have been created as rate card/reporting products in the system. Static products are always accessible throughout the Yield Analytics user interface and may be configured with rate card information and other metadata. They are persistent and may be viewed throughout the Yield Analytics UI.

- Dynamic products are ad-hoc in nature. Ad-hoc products result from inventory queries and there is currently no exact match product for the targeting criteria in the Yield Analytics system. Dynamic products may not have rate cards configured, do not have names, are not persistent, and are not visible in the Yield Analytics UI (with the exception of Product Creation where non-persisted products may be viewed).

Yield Analytics REST API functionality treats these two classes of products symmetrically whenever possible. However, there are certain API calls which apply strictly to static products. These static-product-only API calls are limited to interfaces requiring the use of either a Yield Analytics internal product ID or external product ID where the mapping looking is by nature persistent. Discovery functionality works primarily against static products, inventory data retrieval functionality works regardless of whether a product is static or dynamic.

## Content types

The Service REST API is currently designed to support the following content type:

- JSON - using `Content-type: application/json`

Selecting the desired content type is a choice the API developer should make on a case by case basis. API functionality is symmetrical across content types. API developers may specify the desired content type in the HTTP GET or POST method parameters or via their AJAX or HTTP client library.

## Error checking and status codes

API developers should check the HTTP response codes returned from the service REST API to detect errors propagated from API calls. Successful calls to the service will result in 200 range response codes. 400 and 500 range http responses denote errors. The specific response codes and text will likely undergo change during BETA development of the API, however, the ranges will not.

## Security

The service API exposes application data in a secure manner. Use of API functionality is restricted to authenticated users and is exposed over secure transport protocols. Access to the API must take place within the following context:

- **Example cURL authentication**

  Authentication occurs by passing credentials via http headers on each request.

  ```
  - username: curl -H "username:username"
  - password: curl -H "password:password"
  - source: curl -H "source:client_id"
  ```

- **Example HTTPS authentication**

  ```
  GET /api/v1/rest/
  HTTPS/1.1
  Host: yieldanalytics.xandr.com
  Accept: application/xml, application/json
  Content-Type: application/json
  username: {{username}}
  password: {{password}}
  source: {{client_id}}        
  ```

- **Example POSTMAN authentication**

  Find an example of header settings in Postman below:

    >
    > - 'Authorization' is set to "No Auth"; the settings below are to be placed in the 'Headers' tab.

## Confidentiality

Confidentiality is maintained by using Secure Socket Layer based communication to interact with the Yield Analytics API. API developers should prefer use of HTTPS over HTTP insecure communication whenever possible. Consult your HTTP Client library on how to enable HTTP over SSL when developing outside of a web browser context.

## Paths

### Bulk product creation

```
POST /api/v1/rest/product/bulk/create
```

- **Description**

  Uniqueness of records is defined by productId and externalId. If neither of those is present then the row will result in a NEW product
  record (possibly with a new [generated] product name).

  If productId is provided then it MUST correspond to a product id in our system; otherwise an error is returned.

  In this scenario we will UPDATE the designated product.

  > [!NOTE]
  > We do not check the externalId, we simply update this record. This means if an externalId was provided in the request but does not match the product found by this productId, we will update the externalId on this product with the new value provided. If externalId conflicts with a pre-existing externalId from another product, this update will fail and an error message will be generated.

  - If productId is NOT provided then we will check for externalId.
  - If externalId is provided and a product with that externalId exists in our system then that product will be UPDATED.
  - If externalId is provided and a product with that externalId does NOT exist in our system, the product will be CREATED.
  - If neither productId nor externalId is provided then we will create a new product.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Product Name is not required to be unique when creating or updating products, but a post-process will run that renames products which overlap. Any product name which conflicts with another product in the system is renamed to productName-{productId} (our internal product id); thereby creating a unique name for that product.

  For each uploaded set of products our system will generate a hash based on the contents of the file (and/or post-body) (using MD5 algorithm) and stored with the product data. This protects against duplicate uploads of the exact same data (or file). Duplicate posts will result in an error message that the request is a duplicate.

### Get consumption detail by external ID batch

```
GET /api/v1/rest/product/consumption/batch/externalids/{queries}/{groupingInfo}
```

- **Description**

  The External ID Product Consumption API call can also be called in a batch mode, where more than one combination of external ID, start date, and end date can be queried for in a single call. In this case, the Inventory Batch Lookup Response structure will be returned from the call. This structure wraps multiple Inventory Detail structures, one for each query made to the batch API call. In case an invalid External ID is passed in, the API will return a NOT_FOUND constant for all string values in the ProductDetail structure.

### Get consumption detail by external ID

```
GET /api/v1/rest/product/consumption/externalid/{externalId}/{startDate}/{endDate}/{groupingInfo}
```

- **Description**

  The use of the External ID Product Consumption API is limited to lookups where a static product has been configured with an external ID. This allows API developers to use an external correlating identifier to lookup Yield Analytics Product Consumption information. In order to use the External ID a persistent mapping must be specified, configured, and maintained in the Yield Analytics system. Contact your Yield Analytics Administrator to setup this mapping.

### Find products by match phrase

```
GET /api/v1/rest/product/discover/matchphrase/{matchphrase}
```

- **Description**

  Match Phrase functionality is the easiest Product Discovery functionality to use. It may be used to retrieve static-only products from the Yield Analytics API. The Match Phrase specifies a text string to be matched in a case-insensitive manner against both product names and included-only Product Targeting criteria term values. The specified text matches anywhere in the name or included term values but not against the attribute names or excluded term values. For example when specifying a match phrase; 'Food', both a product named ROS Food and a product having category=FOODLOVER would match.

- **Parameters**
  
  | Type | Name | Description | Required | Schema |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | PathParameter | matchphrase | matchphrase | true | string |
  | HeaderParameter | username | Your username for accessing the Yield Analytics API | true | string |

### Find products by targeting characteristics

```
GET /api/v1/rest/product/discover/targetingcharacteristics/{characteristics}
```

- **Description**

  Targeting Criteria current functionality allows the API developer to interact with static products. A future API release may allow for the exact match in the `ProductLookupResponse` to be created from the specific Targeting Criteria passed. Targeting Criteria is used to provide more exact matching than the Match Phrase functionality. When using the Targeting Criteria functionality, API developers may specify the specific attribute names and values to match. Both inclusion '=' or exclusion '!=" may be specified. Multiple term values for the same attribute may also be supplied. The above example will match any product having category=food and category=cooking where the size is 350x200. Note that the matched products will usually have other targeting attributes defined.

- **Parameters**

### Get inventory and contention by target expression with displacement

```
POST /api/v1/rest/product/inventoryandcontention/displacement/targetexpression/{startDate}/{endDate}/{aliasFunctions}
/{consumptionFilter}
```

- **Description**

  In cases where both inventory forecast data and contender data is required, overall performance and throughput can be maximized by leveraging the Inventory and Contention based APIs. There are both single call and batch invocation options. When multiple inventory and contention is being retrieved for a variety of products or targets, the batch option should be preferred or the API should be accessed in a multithreaded manner. Calls to the Inventory and Contention APIs may be filtered using the Yield Analytics API consumptionFilter filter specification syntax.

  Additionally, the Inventory and Contention API offers flexible extraction of order line dimensional data using Query Engine aliases.

  The Inventory And Consumption API may be invoked via both GET and POST http methods. The use of POST is strongly recommended as this lessens the escaping required due to conflicting characters between the supplied target expression and URL legal characters.
