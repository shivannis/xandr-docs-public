# Bulk product creation service

## Overview

The Yield Analytics API and services are exposed via a REST based interface. It is intended to make development of custom functionality comfortable to developers experienced with Web 2.0, AJAX, REST, and service oriented development platforms. Developers should have familiarity with web-based application paradigms including AJAX, XML, JSON, and the HTTP(S) protocol prior to attempting development with the Yield Analytics API and services.

The Bulk Product Creation API currently exposes interfaces related to:

- Bulk Product Creation
- Bulk Product Creation Status

## Content types

The Service REST API is currently designed to support the following content type:

- JSON - using `Content-type: application/json`

Selecting the desired content type is a choice the API developer should make on a case by case basis. API functionality is symmetrical across content types. API developers may specify the desired content type in the HTTP GET or POST method parameters or via their AJAX or HTTP client library.

## Error checking and status codes

API developers should check the HTTP response codes returned from the service REST API to detect errors propagated from API calls. Successful calls to the service will result in 200 range response codes. 400 and 500 range http responses denote errors. The specific response codes and text will likely undergo change during BETA development of the API, however, the ranges will not.

## Security

The service API exposes application data in a secure manner. Use of API functionality is restricted to authenticated users and is exposed over secure transport protocols. Access to the API must take place within the following context:

- **Example cURL authentication**

  Authentication occurs by passing credentials via http headers on each request.

  ```
  - username: curl -H "username:username"
  - password: curl -H "password:password"
  - source: curl -H "source:client_id"        
  ```

- **Example HTTPS authentication**

  ```
  GET /api/v1/rest/
  HTTPS/1.1
  Host: yieldanalytics.xandr.com
  Accept: application/xml, application/json
  Content-Type: application/json
  username: {{username}}
  password: {{password}}
  source: {{client_id}}        
  ```

- **Example POSTMAN authentication**

  Find an example of header settings in Postman below:

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > - 'Authorization' is set to "No Auth"; the settings below are to be placed in the 'Headers' tab.
    > - For a more in depth tutorial of using Postman, see [Using Postman with the Yield Analytics API](using-postman-with-the-yield-analytics-api.md).

## Confidentiality

Confidentiality is maintained by using Secure Socket Layer based communication to interact with the Yield Analytics API. API developers should prefer use of HTTPS over HTTP insecure communication whenever possible. Consult your HTTP Client library on how to enable HTTP over SSL when developing outside of a web browser context.

### POST: Bulk product creation

```
POST /api/products/bulk/create
```

- **Description**

  Uniqueness of records is defined by productId and externalId. If neither of those is present then the row will result in a NEW product record (possibly with a new [generated] product name).

  If productId is provided then it MUST correspond to a product id in our system; otherwise an error is returned.

  In this scenario we will UPDATE the designated product.

  > [!NOTE]
  > We do not check the externalId, we simply update this record. This means if an externalId was provided in the request but does not match the product found by this productId, we will update the externalId on this product with the new value provided. If externalId conflicts with a pre-existing externalId from another product, this update will fail and an error message will be generated.

  - If productId is NOT provided then we will check for externalId.
  - If externalId is provided and a product with that externalId exists in our system then that product will be UPDATED.
  - If externalId is provided and a product with that externalId does NOT exist in our system, the product will be CREATED.
  - If neither productId nor externalId is provided then we will create a new product.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Product Name is not required to be unique when creating or updating products, but a post-process will run that renames products which overlap. Any product name which conflicts with another product in the system is renamed to productName-{productId} (our internal product id); thereby creating a unique name for that product.

  For each uploaded set of products our system will generate a hash based on the contents of the file (and/or post-body) (using MD5 algorithm) and stored with the product data. This protects against duplicate uploads of the exact same data (or file). Duplicate posts will result in an error message that the request is a duplicate.
