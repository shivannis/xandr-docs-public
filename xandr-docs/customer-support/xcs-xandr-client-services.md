# Client services

Welcome to the Xandr Client Services organization. This guide covers our mission, business relationship with you, issue resolution process, and other helpful resources.

All requests can be submitted and routed to the appropriate Xandr team directly from our Customer Support form located at the [Customer Support Portal](https://help.xandr.com).

## Our mission

Xandr Client Services is striving to set a new industry standard for customer responsiveness and communication. We achieve our higher standard in a few ways:

1. We are your single point of contact for technical problems with the Xandr platform. Whether the issue can be resolved quickly or requires a long-term engineering fix, we will communicate with you until it's fully resolved.
1. On an ongoing basis, Client Services shares with you the best practices and helpful tips we've learned. We are a frequent contributor to the email list. We also provide free product training as part of the Xandr Customer Webinar Program.
1. Xandr Client Services are provided at no additional cost to Xandr customers. If you have any question, please be sure to reach out to your Xandr Account Representative.

## You and Client Services: A Partnership

It is our highest priority to help you succeed, and we aim to surpass your expectations of us as a service organization. This includes resolving technical issues quickly and effectively, giving helpful advice, and working hard to provide a stable and reliable technology platform for your business. We also aim to provide comprehensive and informative documentation to enable our customers to be more self-sufficient. We view our relationship with you as a partnership. In the spirit of that partnership, there are a few things that you can do to help us extend service to you more effectively:

1. Please review our relevant articles prior to submitting a support request. The Documentation Help Center is a massive source of information that we have dedicated significant effort into building as a customer resource.
1. Please do as much research and triaging of issues as possible before submitting a request to our team. Your upfront effort will ultimately help us resolve your issues faster.
1. Please contact your internal Xandr subject matter expert, or “SME”, with potential technical issues. Your Xandr SME will be able to assist you with confirming the issue and constructing an informative support request to our team.
1. After you have performed a thorough investigation on your end, please include the following detailed information in your support request:
    1. Description of the problem, including as much detail as possible, and the impact on your immediate goals
    1. All relevant object IDs
    1. Environment details (bidder id, member id, creative id, etc)
    1. Steps to reproduce the problem, including test pages, URLs, etc.
    1. Screenshot(s) for all UI-related issues
    1. Browser and Operating System used (including version numbers)

## What types of requests should go to Client Services?

The Client Services team is your single point of contact for all technical issues pertaining to our ad platform. We are excited to help you leverage our technology to drive success for your business. We are here to reinforce best practices taught during your initial training, help to correct day-to-day issues occurring across your buying or selling, and to identify and resolve any product bugs or gaps. We will dig deeply into any unexpected behavior that you may find and work together with our Engineering team to ensure that we provide the most stable and efficient ad platform possible.

The Xandr platform is constantly evolving to meet the varied needs of our growing customer base. Our Product and Engineering teams are dedicated to releasing useful features to help our customers drive more success on the platform, however we recognize that we do not have the capacity to deliver on every product enhancement request that we receive. Our Client Services team is available to make important configuration changes or to pull necessary data sets in cases where specific functionality is not currently available in our product and there is a corresponding strong business justification for the request.

In summary, the request types will be directed via the support form to the following teams as shown below:

| Request Type | Example | Xandr Team |
|---|---|---|
| Anti-malvertising questions | Creative loading malware served on owner's inventory | Anti-Malvertising |
